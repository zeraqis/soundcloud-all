@organic-io: are you suggesting much more exciting synths or full-on piano/orchestra/whatever? if it's synths you're after, maybe you should remix it! the file's here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a2inzb8sv42o1we/til_spc73n (it's called a journey of styles.sunvox)~1
@organic-io: thank you! i was super happy that it came out like that, so i'm glad that you are too!~1
@organic-io: to be honest, i was surprised that the a (in the upper part) worked with the bb in the lower part, but the dissonance is quite nice here!~1
@organic-io: wow! you sound like you have a lot on your hands :) well, i have sibelius at the ready, so i might have a go at orchestrating it! i'd love to hear what you make with it! if you want to combine it with some of my other stuff, all of the .sunvoxes are here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a2inzb8sv42o1we/til_spc73n~1

@wobblesmusic: no offense intended either bro this track is just the dirty i like~1
@wobzor: aww that sucks dude, i hate buying new headphones every couple of months, im lucky i managed to get my hands on a set of studio dre beats, was sceptical bout them at first but when it comes to mixing i couldnt believe how good they were, you really do get what you pay for~1
@wobzor: bruce lee..~1
@wobzor: dont listen to this guy, use whatever sequencer your comfortable with, they all do the same thing, in terms of making your own sounds i agree, though t's takin me a while to get to the point where im comfortable doing that because you'l burn hours away trying to perfect that sound, i still use presets even, but its just a matter of lazyness, sweet track btw, good composition ~1
@wobzor: dude i need some massive tips you have it down..~1
@wobzor: fucking hell fam, this shit is mad hard!!~1
@wobzor: just asked :) mabye we can collab sometime?~1
@wobzor: kidacina momce, pozz zi zenice~1

@wobzor: sounds great man~1

a~1
a bit messy?~1
a bit minimalistic here~1
a bit much of the same but a nice dark energy here~1
a bit short~1
a bit stagnant for me, however the mix is pretty clean so good work as a whole!~1
a bit too experimental for me but its pretty cool! ~1
a bit too wacked out for my taste but still refreshing :)~1
a classic tune :d~1
a def download :)) thx :)~1
a dj/producers job is to incorporate the old with new sometimes.~1
a drunk production.~1
a fantastic piece of what you can do with one synth~1
a full track with great mixing too! ~1
a great adventure this track took me on~1
a great bootleg, wish the bpm were a bit faster :)~1
a great changedown from the mayhem.~1
a great listen and very apparent attention to detail~1
a great liveset, really, love your techno dude !~1
a great mix of sounds, not overcompressed~1
a great remix of one of favourite track, you have definitely just it justice~1
a helpline for families has been set up~1
a hit!~1

a joy~1
a klassic kill...~1
a la merga meeel~1
a la vrga..!~1
a little cleaning up tho and this will be a great track! :)~1
a little different style here ..~1
a little light for my tastes~1
a little off~1
a little too funky of a mashup...~1
a long way of saying 'i'm not quite sure'.~1
a lot of creative bass work to find at your profile! ~1
a lot of good combos~1
a lot of positives to take from this~1
a more classic song in its genre, but nonetheless very effective and well mixed :)~1
a new kind of dnb, sometimes slow can be good too, nice work man!!~1
a part without me?~1
a pretty basic techno tune into a drop~1
a real in your face mix, the pulsing synth and hard bass make this the heavy metal songs of dubstep~1
a real journey~1
a really cool remix for the dirty deeds  yall! cool and powerfull dnb.~1
a really well created track! i like the melody! ~1
a reverb would work nicely here.~1
a seamless build vrom 736nv!~1
a sign of good things to come~1
a standout mix -- fat and full sounding~1
a strange genre but good production :)~1
a trap mix does this well, nice man!~1
a unique vibe due to the mixing on this one~1
a very awesome mix!~1
a very powerful track .~1
a very solid trap track, great atmosphere made with those quality sounds, hear some prodigy too~1
a well produced track regarding sound.it kind of gets a bit boring with this one melody playing over again.add a secondary lead.~1

abseloutely beautiful track~1
absolut krank <3~1
absolute filth! :]~1
absolute house banger, love the fidgety percussive track, the deep soothing bass part, snappy snares clinging to the tight, laid-back arrangement, excellent manipulation of the groove and tidy editing of the main sequence, excellent work!~1

"~1

aczkolwiek to tylko takie to~1
adagolos ;)~1
add an 8 bar gap here, let the synths play out for the duration of the gap and then when you re introduce the beat layer a couple of new kicks snares and hats in there to bump it up a notch :d ~1
add echo too~1
add me on facebook(https://www.facebook.com/#!/young.don.g.p ) ....nothin but respect..~1
add side chain compression to your bass~1
add some of your own sounds here!~1
adding one would take this track into a new level, which would make the track total kickazz~1
additional dl-link anywhere? would be rather awesome :d~1
admittedly, i may do this more often than i should but it's a hardcore hardwired part of me.~1
adnie :)~1
adoro dnb..essas batidas ficaram otimas..gosto desse trabalho..muito criativo !!~1
ae porra \o/~1
aehooooooo :v~1
aesome job on this one, the mixing is spot-on, the sound design is pretty great~1

afelix13 - call me maybe remix (carly rae jepsen)~1
afrojack would be proud, wouldnt be suprised if he rocked this live !! keep a lookout on his show jacked & his live sets !! you might hear your track bumping~1
afrotrackers :p~1
after chilling breakdown, nice beat, it would be great to hear it in club!~1
after hearing the backing go from soft to hard, i realize how great on an idea that is~1
after listening to this song, i went to bed and forgot tot turn off my swag~1
after that great intro the drop kinda dissapoints me, you should work a little more on your bass patches they don't sound really good at the moment~1
after that, it was just mixing and accidentals.~1
again a perfect track!  see you on fiesta!~1
again nice synth sounds and melodies :)~1
again thanks for feedbck~1

alex young x the hi-yahs - so much ~1
"all ""santino"" music videos @  http://www.youtube.com/user/reallhiphopdropz"~1
all 3 sections were strong and held together really well~1
all about the dubstep eh?~1
all cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing for one's enjoyment to highly planned and organised performance rituals such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, music festivals or music competitions~1
all dat hl2 sfx~1
all day son!~1
all eyes on us~1
all eyes on us!!~1
all for the music~1
all good~1
all good mate +++++~1
all his beats are woahhh!!~1
all i have is this fucking dubstep~1
all in all pretty good track :d~1
all in all this track is good, keep up the great work.~1
all in all, you have a nice sound.~1
"all my friends kept saying, wait for the ""down pony"" set in the morning!! at least, that's what i thought they were saying at the time :-) as much as i liked the thugfucker set, i was really in the mood for something just like this mix when it got around the time of your scheduled set (7-sh am, i think)"~1
all my life i've been waitin' for someone like you, yeah!!~1
all of the percussive elements in this song are what drives the overall feel of this production~1
all over the place, yes.~1
all so awsome!~1
all sounds are nice and smooth...~1
all sounds are perfect~1
all sounds nice but think would be better making one lead hook really strong and keeping that throughout~1
all tastefully and with deliberation~1
all that aside, this is a greeaaat song! <3 f3nning~1
all the info is in the description anyway~1
all the same thing.~1
all the songs are different, yet they have the distinct lukedaduke style.~1
all the work i do is hard for me.~1
all these basses!!! fcking epic remix! :d~1
all these chords fit so well together i really like how tighten it all up with some compression man ~1
all these stabs are playin real nice with each other~1
all these stacked synths effects etc reallly play a huge effect~1
all these tracks are great! great sounds, samples, and drops! keep it up!~1
all this love!!~1
all time fav~1
all we want is filth~1
all your songs a really great, followed..~1
all your songs are sick!~1
all your tracks are so good~1
all your work?~1
almost like space invanders at beginning ~1
almost listened the whole track and i really liked it , perfect doned~1
almost lost mi fuckin bridges yo....~1
almost scare vibes here, great hats~1
alot goin on here ...pretty cool!~1
alot goin on in here~1
already a sick vibe~1
already amazing dude!~1
already sounds pretty damn badass man~1
alright here comes the bootlegs...this is one of the smoother ones ive heard today~1
"alright!!! love it~ smiling~"~1
alright!!!!~1
als een baaaaaas!!~1
alskar det har!~1
also great start -- your mixing skills are great::)~1
also i just uploaded my original track so check it out!~1
also i really dont have time since i have exams and currently making an ep with alexander srbinoski.~1
also loving the dnb swag~1
also massive mix man you are the don bruv x~1
also right after this first 8 bar shizz, it brings back the initial synth work from the build~1
also sorry for one mis spelled word it's obviously worse than using wrong tense~1
also worth saying is the way you implement an amen break, if i'm not mistaken, into a dubstep song~1
also you could put more dubstep elements and try to add some chop in the vocals~1
also you have a very cool backing bassline and some very nicely programmed drums~1
also, add riser-fx and other accent-fx to create builds.~1
also, don't mention cracks out loud, mang~1
also, i could just imagine this song being amazing with lyrics.~1
also, love the cover art, goes well with the mood of the track~1
also, my unitor has died after 14 years of loyal service, so i bought a cheap behringer midi adapter set to run everything instead.)~1
also, there's a note that's being played by the strings that's clashing and not fitting in with the other sounds.~1
alter schwede, mega track, da freu ich mich doch direkt aufs album!danke fur den free dl!~1
alter! fett~1
alter, du gonnst einem auch keine pause :)~1
alternative~1
although i can't believe this is coming out first...it'll be a century before tokyo or feel the pressure come out.~1
"although most of the victims are belgian, <b><a href=""http://www.comelygirls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wig</a><b> swiss officials say the dead include seven dutch children"~1
although, add a bit more bass and give the kick more punch and it will be a solid track~1
alto remix bro!!, chopped and screwed~1

an assault of awesome at the drop here! great song all round!~1
an exelent mix.~1
ancient fuckn aliens i tell ya~1
and a couple of dogs ~1
and a perfect old school song~1
and action !~1
and also maybe try switching up from that wobble bassline to some growls or lasers so its not as repetitive and bland in a way (the bassline)~1
and also, remove your track from soundcloud because all remixes that are posted public before winners are declared will be disqualified (see competition rules)~1
and an amazing intro~1
"and bam
"~1
and build ups and drops are pro~1
and dark o:~1
and drooooop~1
and drop~1

and even that's a poor excuse~1
and feminism~1
and give some love to http://soundcloud.com/iamwuki !~1

and i woke up covered in bitches~1
and it begins!!! perfect timing.~1
and it has a beat!!!!~1
and it's a free download~1
and just like that, this song makes it into my favorites list...~1
and long bring back with the synth keys again...~1
and maybe another harmonic bassline ~1
and maybe its a feeling that no one else will get when they listen to my music, because im biased and they're not~1
and my boy does it again!! great work brother :d~1
and neat work on making the song~1
and of coarse, each track on the mix will be remixed in some way by me~1
and on 8:42ish.~1
and on bandcamp! http://bsxmusic.bandcamp.com/track/bsx-hyperdrop-revival-ep~1
and please remove those vocals - but that's all just my opinion, hope i didn't sound rude.~1
and sooo remix on skrillex, of course~1
and sub bass of course~1
and thank you!~1
and thanx man! yeah 500, sweeet~1
and that can only be a good thing~1

as far as bar count, everything is on point~1
as good as usual:) .....~1
as long as they keep coming back..~1
as much as i liked it.....3 minute intro using the same melody got a bit much then the beats kicked in for just over a minute then back to the melody again.maybe im just more of a beats and baseline man.anyway if everyone liked the same things it would be boring.nice try~1
as soon as i heard the intro i knew this was gonna be epic, great work~1
as soon as the song came on i loved it.~1
as usual witdubstep, i like the intro, but not the rest :) but it's well made.~1
as well as this the drums shoulf of changed at somepoint and the synth lead seems a bit over powering~1

but a pretty good arrangement and synth line, you are definitely on the right track.~1

but despite that good work~1
but good arrangement ~1
but good tune~1
but great work! :)~1
but how is it cold blooded?~1
but huge thanks for listening!~1
but i also don't hate him among all the other spammers.~1
but i am worried that you will travel further than sound can travel in my lifetime, so i hope you stay close so i can continue to enjoy the vibes you put out and the awesomeness that you two are~1
but i can totally see that working~1
but i create sounds with massive, my own and i have presets :) im fine with that~1
but i do like this track tho..~1
but i don't understand how this is a remix~1
but i don't you just sit around and listen to techno~1
but i have to ask, if you think it's terrible, why upload it?~1
but i hear that~1
but i know that on reason, you can right click on a pattern and tell it to randomize a pattern~1
but i like the background synths alot, good job :d~1
"but i like the high hat
"~1
but i love it~1
but i really like it~1
but i'm enjoying the creativity!! ~1
but if you guys could pleace check my tracks out and maby drop a comment :) ? it means alot thanks :d~1
but if you want another file hit me up and i'll send it to you~1
but in monitr..its sound perfect.~1
but is nice to hear you enjoy it..~1
but it does have the proressive feel where it constantly changes too~1
but it's hot as fuck ;d~1
but it's worth it!~1
but its fine i guess~1
but its good~1
but its justified.~1
but its not just that, i used doctor p &flux pavillion sound, datsik, excision xd thanks btw and for the drums ye i only use basic and add a little reverbs~1
but just wait til u c whats on the horizon!~1
but maybe that's just my taste~1
but nice track :d~1
but nice try~1
but not bad~1
but other than that, the timing is awesome.~1
but other then that, flawless~1
but otherwise,  i had a eargazm, and multiple seizures from this track~1
"but otherwise, really cool track bro!
keep up the good work!
"~1
but pretty damn heavy.~1
but seriously, thanks a lot, electrode - glad you like it!~1
but since this is a remix, there mightn't be anything you can do about that.~1
but solid tune :)~1
but still, i like the song.~1
but thanks! :d~1
but that feeling that it gives me is unlike any other music i have listened to, its better~1
but thats just my opinion :) greetings, lwrnc~1
but the brutality is totally there~1
but the drop is a remake.~1
but the melody on this is to repetitive chaplin vocals arnt really incorperated effectly in this i feel/// why not use some efx on chaplins voice~1
but the rhythm is really overused~1
but the track is cool, with or without lazers~1
but this is just a subjective view and it is a great track on its own~1
but when that drop kicked in it came togeather a bit better....theres somthing mechnical sounding about this track though~1
but wheres the download!?~1
but you are right!~1
but you can work it out~1
but you got it good yo~1
but you got the progressive feeling right~1
but your doing great so far.~1

chamber music, which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than symphonic works.~1
change of background percussion here and in the next few seconds really diversifies the song...i like how you're avoiding a mundane beat and adding in other beats in the background~1
change that melody it doesn't fit with the beat and harmonic ~1
"change title to ""must be the noise"""~1

cos the product you upload must be the final product....no?~1
could bang a bit harder but over all it was good production~1
could be a totally different song with the same name~1
could be more bass in your face buts its very cool like it :)~1
could be much better mixed, cleaned and mastered~1
could have added some impact.~1
could have my pop singer kill this joint!~1
could it be sylenth1 ;) keep up the good work and you will get very far in you music career!~1
could maybe use some additional sounds! :)~1
could of been nicer~1
could provide some sick extra groove :)~1
could use some action if you know what i mean, but its a good start thats forsure! i like the glitchy parts, those are sweet~1
could use some better samples in the drums, but great synth work~1
could use some eq'ing in the mix~1
could've rendered as flac to lower filesize but keep audio quality, but this song is awesome anyway~1
couldn't conceptualise an approach for this one, but you made it look easy~1

death drop!!!~1
death the kid u know how it is hate to dismiss any mistake  if it aint right then u must be kidding  jokes mislead becuz you are now slipping   oblique mind then i give a fix simply blast it  it aint a trick just one click then the second click  rest is oh my goodness ur history  it ain't a mystery to entry just that i'm not so intrigued  don't get it wrong son i'm a sweet treat  bang bang bang bang have a nice dream   if it ain't proper, it's incomplete  making me shiver because you lacking heat  stop taking chances it's real steep  inowjwatch when you sleep cuz my glocks creep   not enough for me to satisfy  any mistakes let's clarify  let's post it on the classified  find the bad and boom bye-bye   do it together with my entourage  placing you head in the back of garage  have a litlle sale and sell you cheap  so please get out i'm out of your leagueiyou knowj   you still don't understand the range that you stay in  i ain't playin  no more tradin losing it it ain't easy to get back  you know what i'm sayin  hit your case with a big back slap  click the gat and go bla bla bla  everything i touch will go platinum  somehow people around me clappin it yep~1
decent production and ideas, but the progression feels pretty slow~1
decent rhythm i think it could def use a little more love and it'd be good- needs some intro outro action tho~1
decent track ~1
decious: like this voice ! <3~1

deffs huge tune, big ups for the release~1
definately just jizzed a little from dat drop xd~1
definately playing this next time i dj~1
definetely :d~1
definetly for fast forwarded video~1
definitely a pace changer! got that upbeat and awesome blend of craziness to make ya just lose yourself in the mix of this nicely done sounds like a torn remix for sure~1
definitely a really cool sound! i really like this~1
definitely an intriguing concept, seems a little empty on either the perc side or little additive synth side..~1
definitely big potential for the club~1
definitely bobbed my head the whole song lol~1
definitely did rihanna justice.~1
definitely diggin this mash up, never heard the two songs but man you killed em in a mash so i'm not complaining! :d~1
definitely downloading :d~1
definitely got some unique production, sounds are odd but good~1
definitely intentional, as most house rekkids have a 64 bar plain drum intro to allow for mixing~1
definitely liking the vibes here~1
definitely makes me wanna get into a nice small club with great sound and get a few drinks in me and partaayy! lol~1
definitely need a break at the moment though :d cheers man!~1
definitely nightmareish~1

every song i do is somewhat of an expiriment~1
every sound needs it s own room~1
every time!~1
everybody get up it's time...~1
everybody git upp, it's time to slam now~1
everyone go follow glis6 on youtube! this is his outro as well~1
everyone is giving his attention to the track because of the bi!i!ig blue xd ;d~1
everyone looks like aliens at this point :o <3~1
everyone's on fire todaythis is great!~1
everything about this sounds so clean, the piano synth and melody go together perfectly~1
everything but dubstep is not mine ^^ ~1
"everything in this track works tho!
keep elevatin, g"~1
everything is good, i just don't like this synth~1
everything is ok.~1
everything is perfect,and the tracks is just too nice :)~1
everything is placed nice in the mix, and i dig the sound pallet you use~1
everything is sick, the kick itself could be a different one, but still works real heavy~1
everything is so crystal clear this is amazing, but my fav is still the bass ^^~1
everything is sound on point! props! ~1
everything is under control..~1
everything looks perfect until the track reaches this point you might want to add some synths because the waveform looks empty..~1
everything seems to be mixed well, and the melodies you are using are nice~1
everything sits nice and tight, good job~1
everything sits proper in here good work ~1
everything sounds so pro:)~1
"everythings well mixed
"~1
everytime i listen, this is the part that sends chills up my spine~1
everytime this awesom music from random moments, love it <3~1

honestly  this is hands down one of the best dubstep songs i have ever heard~1

i adore it~1
i agree :)~1
i agree with indy..~1
i agree with you on that, not a massive fan of this section to be honest either :)~1
i agree, real nice work~1
i almost want to call this minimal house~1
i already got the only copy nigger~1
i also like melodies~1
i also like the different combination of snares/claps you use~1
i also like the fade in and progression of the beat at the progression :) cool chops and pans also it's apparent you have a knack for producing :)~1
i also like the vocals very much~1
i also like your synths too~1

i am really digging the low end grit on the bass..~1

i am stunned by the stuff you are doing~1
i am sure you got some hot stuff....~1
i an  liking this! very nice man~1
i appreciate that !~1
i appreciate the support thank you~1
i be liking this chune - hey! da da da da~1
i bet there are plugins to get these effects, but i definitely need to explore logic pro more and make my own sounds~1
"i came :o
lol"~1
i came here after searching melodic dubstep on youtube woo! now sound all the way up and eyes shut~1
i came really hard.......~1
i came sand~1
i came..~1
i can be in the worst mood and if i watch balloon shop i swear everything is fine afterwards~1
i can dance to this~1
i can def imagine this being played on a brooklyn rooftop!~1
i can dig it~1
i can dig this :) i think the drop has quite a bit more potential, but there is naice production skills and techniques in here ^^~1
i can dig this.~1
i can feel a mitits there lol.~1
i can feel it~1
i can feel it in my heart bum bum ayyyyy yeahhh!!!!!~1
i can feel it! amazing! ro ro ro rock and steady~1
i can feel tht~1
i can hear the bassline has a lot of work put into it, it's much better than anything i've achieved, some of the sounds could be better~1
i can hear the fl in this! :) nice track~1
i can hear this in a movie man~1
i can hear this on a satellite radio station ~1
i can hear what you were trying to do with the snare, but it needs to be a bit more meaty~1
i can imagine this song playing out really well at a show~1
i can only say: nice track~1
i can picture this being played at a night club :d this is amazing bro keep it up (:~1
"i can reach the sky with this music
"~1
i can see a shogun commin now~1
i can see clubbers liking this~1
i can sense it coming~1
i can sense the native instruments :p~1
i can tell it's gonna be dope already.~1
i can tell you put a lot of time into this~1
i can tell you went somewhere with this.~1
i can't do it very well~1
i can't find this song on itunes????~1
i can't get a thing for the vocals:x~1
i can't get enough~1
i can't get the dl link to work without the annoying 4shared site trying to make me register~1
i can't hear any of the original! it's awesome!!!~1
i can't say anything but....want want want want~1
i can't seem to get into it....~1

i cant tie my shoes~1
i changed that one on the nitty gritty mix~1
i choose doe :d~1
i commend you on such hard work to make the best product possible~1
i could def help you with plays~1
i could def vibe to this~1
i could definitely see this being set to the backdrop of attempting to escape a space station about to explode, or even something such as trying outmaneuver a boss enemy to hit their weak spot~1
i could drink and smoke or just chill too this~1
i could drop to this very sleek and smooth!~1
i could give you some feedback though! it's pretty good for only spending two hours on it, but if you put more effort and time into it, it would be much, much better~1
i could have lived without them~1
i could hear this track on the radio any day of the week! hot!~1
i could help you recreate the sound if you want.~1
i could imagine hearing this at one of those cheesy clubs in cancun~1
i could not do a better job.~1
i could nudge all day, personally~1

i discovered some fun sounding music with this mix, whats this song, im gonna download the set for in my car, then i will come back to give some more indepth comments~1
i dislike some of the sounds, but that's just because of my opinion~1
i dissagree i think in the intro the hats are bit loud .~1
i do feel that this track could use some melody~1
i do love a quickie lol~1
i do prefer your dnb, but the sporadic glitches are a cool toss in.~1
i do that to build to the sudden change~1
i do the best that i can to please others~1
"i don't actually use logic =( it's just part of my ""project file"" ep =p but we should still find a way to collab! =d"~1
i don't even own a mac~1
i don't have a fb...msg me a download link please???~1
i don't have it labeled as dubstyle though lol~1
i don't hear any progressive house~1
i don't hear the usual wobble bass, so i'm not sure if it would really qualify as dubstep, but it is unique and well done...~1
i don't hear too much easy-going dnb these days - it's very refreshing~1
i don't know if it was intentional but great track.~1
i don't know if it's on purpose, but the sound could be a lot cleaner~1
i don't know who this miranda is, but holy crap this is one of the best sets i've ever run across~1
i don't like slow kastle~1
i don't lol~1
i don't produce i smash:)~1
"i don't really care i prooved my point and teenager kind of sentence won't ever offend me - call me mentally ill, gay or whatever and i just see you're probably not even hitting the ""15"" you mentioned..."~1
i don't really listen to dubstep much but i really enjoyed this! great track~1
i don't understand the lyrics but i'm loving the tune~1
i don't usually like dnb much but this is fat my friend!!~1
i don't want to be a complete fan girl, but i really love the drums and i''m gonna leave it at that before i go any more gaga over this track.~1
i don+t know if i can meditate on it , it s too active and present ~1
i dont know how this progressive house..this is much deeper than that genre..this is like chill idm electronica..great vibes on this track..awesome work on the drums.~1
i dont know how you would ever call this music~1
i dont know what to do or not do on specific genre's..~1
i dont know why drums sound so bad, but try to enjoy! :d~1
i dont knwo what genre is this track is good i think it could be better tho the sound are kinda repetitive tru the entire  track but besides that really good work~1
i dont like spamming but...~1
i dont like this..........~1
i dont listen to this music that much but this aint bad~1
i dont usually do dubstep, but when i do its intransik ;) ~1
i dunno if i~1
i dunno, just an idea~1
i eat beats~1
i enjoy choppin vox and messin with effects..i have a weird style haha~1
i enjoy sharing what i do with the world.~1
i enjoy that it doesnt sound like every other dnb track out there~1
i enjoy the automation on the release time of the synth in the coming phrases~1
i enjoyed all of it~1
i enjoyed it~1
i enjoyed listening to it.~1
i enjoyed this tune~1
"i enjoyed)
a good job"~1
i envy the perfection of that kick~1
i favored your track check out my revival remix and see if you can favor mine tooo homie.....~1
i feel a battle sequence coming~1
i feel half-life almost lol!~1
i feel like a cat who just heard the most intriguing rustle of sound..~1
i feel like a lot probably goes over my head (and i dont consider myself particularly dumb) - thanks so much for taking the time~1
i feel like i've been abducted, disected, sewn back together, anal probed, tagged, and stuck back into the populous.....thanks man.~1
i feel like removing a sound or two may clear this up a little but nice percussion check me out and give me pointers it wuld be appreciated~1
i feel like the progression could use a bit more variance~1
i feel like the snare doesn't have enough low end~1
i feel like there is a whole lot going on through these bars and i dont know what to focus on~1
i feel like there was just too much going on at this point, although the part after this had some good leads to it~1
i feel like this could be a little bigger sounding, it sounds a little soft, but great sounds :) the first part i think was just the flow of energy between the build and the drop, you gotta nail it perfectly to get it to sound just right :)~1
i feel like this is where it should drop!! i want more!!~1
i feel like this remix is on drugs instead of the producers~1
i feel like want to jump!!!!~1
i feel like you must have been doing so many things with electronic music, i know you've been performing all genres since before i was born~1
i feel relaxed of this :)~1
i feel so trapped~1
i feel terrible we didn't originally attribute these tracks to andhim as well cos we got to play with em a year after this set, and it's kinda obvious now which artists were the main impetus in these tracks :p~1
i feel that the drop could b a little bit slower~1
i feel the intro a little long, you could add some variations like this sound~1
i feel you could do more with the chord progressions, perhaps modulate to another key~1
"i felt in love with ya
"~1
i felt like something was a little off but im not sure what and  i still liked it~1
i figure .~1
i find it hard to wrap my brain around most of the disquiet stuff; this one really works for me!~1

i reali like it, keep it updated! =)~1
i realize that some people would think im full of myself for thinking this, but if i put 100% into something thats the way i feel~1
i really didn't, but i think it sounds a metric fuck-ton better now i've remastered it.~1
i really dig the bold synth in this~1
i really dig your sounds~1
i really diggin your instruments and the mixdown seems decent~1
i really enjoy the intro to this too, expansive atmosphere~1
i really enjoy the piano in this song~1
i really enjoyed the lasers you used in this~1
i really feel that reverse nudge is out of place in this track...but otherwise i like your sound~1
i really feel this i could see this playing at a rave or something ~1
i really like chord progression ,nice progressive song ;) maybe more fx will be nice ,mmaster is also good :d~1
i really like it style, very great~1
i really like lead and synth here..~1
i really like that rising~1
i really like that, it drives the song along quite nicely~1
i really like the ah has a nice feeling to the track ~1
i really like the bass vibe on this track~1
i really like the beat to this~1
i really like the beatmmashing going on with this track, and this has a good fast trancey beat to it! nice work kid :-)~1
i really like the blend of different styles throughout~1
i really like the break beat in the beginning and the stabby arp~1
i really like the drop~1
i really like the hihats that float around on top of this~1
i really like the intro claps and snires~1
i really like the originality you put into a trap song~1
i really like the punch to the kick and the crispy percussion, you got me nodding.~1
i really like the synth used throughout the track, this could be a great summer track no doubt about that~1
i really like the tune but the dubstep could be infproved~1
i really like this :)~1
i really like this man, i could dance and chill out at the same time to this.~1
i really like this one man~1

i really like this song~1
i really like this track reall vibrant chillin i dig~1
i really like this, great melody!~1
i really like this.~1
i really like this...so nice and mellow.~1
"i really like what you got going on this song is veryy loungey, but i feel like some of the synths need to be layered/ eqed a lil more to sound more fat
"~1
i really like what you put together even if it is a podcast.~1
i really like your beat here~1
"i really like your sample good job finding it
"~1
i really like your solid sound! for my taste, you put too much compressing to your song, espachially the 4/4 sidechaining - it bothers me while hearing~1
i really liked it !!~1
i really liked the drop good melody only the sidechain could use some more besides from that it sound sick really good job~1
i really love the synths and drums used in this! keep it up!~1
i really love this hook, great sounding mix, clear loud.~1
i really love this plucky synth that you added~1
"i really love this soft part, though in the intro, towards the end of it, the vocals seamed a bit off for a second
"~1
i really love this style, i like this track you got some nice and clean sounds.~1
i really love this synth~1
i really really like this one a lot.~1
i really really liked it !!~1
i really thought it could not be done~1
i really wanna download it, but the mediafire link no longer works! can you post it for download anywhere else?~1
i realy like that intro it like tu tu tu tu tu tuuuu :)~1
i realy loe thees cut outs.~1
"i recently released a track, and
would really appreciate if you checked it
out"~1
"i recently released a track, and
would really appreciate if you checked it out :)"~1
i reckon this will be well accepted on the uk scene, it's got the right attitude.~1
i recognize this preset from sylenth..u used it in a nice way though.i do like the drop and the bass work on it...very deep and full of energy and grit.nice job.~1
i reeeally dig the approach , and i love the tribal vibe ~1
i remember hearing your stuff on youtube way long ago~1
i remember jamming to this up in the club..finally..~1
i remember talking to you over youtube a while ago back when you had very little views and now you're really getting somewhere! keep going, your music is awesome!~1
i remember that synth~1
i remember this :)~1
i remixed this too!!! good job tho.~1
i rock reason.~1
i sang along~1
i saw you on tour eith hoodie allen in seattle~1
i see myself doing push-ups to this~1
i see nipple!~1
i see u nice song~1
i see u on dat next level shit..~1
i see you kyle~1
i sense some huge aphex twin influences here.~1
i seriously love your style~1
i shered this one on my fb page as well :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15q75bm67gy&list=uut9jpjnrwpa-4syd0va-dgw&index=1&feature=plcp~1
i should pick my face up~1
i should try that sometime! (learnding c:)~1
i spend a good 30 hours on my tracks before i consider uploading them, and spent over 60 on one song~1
i spent a lot of time on this song!~1
i started to tap my foot :)~1
i still like this remix how it is.~1
i suggest to turn the volume up for the bass~1
i swear this melody <3~1
i swear this mix will never get old!~1
i take it back :( wtf.~1
i thank you so kindly....................~1
i the real first~1
i think a little more compression could have made this song really good~1
i think adding more sounds to crate a melody isnt bad idea..~1
i think i hear sum 303's in here.~1
i think i just came in my pants....~1
i think i may have heard this before...hm...this song has evolved so much xd~1
i think i'm in love lol nice vocal editing!~1
i think i'm in love with this mix.~1
i think if you add some melodic instruments like piano or lighter synths that might make it a little better.~1
i think im gunna have to put up a free chipstep song !~1
i think it would have an overall smoother feel at 128 bpm or so~1
i think it'd sound wayy doper without that one-shot impact at the drop~1
i think it's a bit too early to call that one~1
"i think of you: ""not bad"" :d"~1
i think people might appreciate it if you'd do that.~1
i think someone eatin my frosted flakes~1
i think that ur basswork is nice but it doesnt really match up so well with her vocals.its like two different things happpening at once with no relation.....~1
i think that'll do it~1
i think the build up takes a bit too long but nick drop~1
i think the female voice is being triggered a little bit too much~1
i think the initial drop can slam down a bit harder (impact sound, crash, something) but this track is absolutely stellar~1
i think the intro should have had more~1
i think the rest of the arrangement is a little naked compared to the percussion.~1
i think the snare could be a little brighter though.~1
i think the track is great as it is though.~1
i think these might be the droids were looking for.~1
i think this build up is pretty awesome!~1
i think this coulda been abit more organised~1
i think this is a very fresh track for a party time~1
i think this is the best one ;) nice work here ~1
i think this is where i lost my shit~1
i think this jam here is very well made~1
i think this may be your best one.~1
i think u will like it :) listen https://soundcloud.com/jajabursova/my-name-is-dj-jay~1
i think we are assembled~1
i think we have alot in cmon~1
i think with a good ammount of eq and layering this one will be chart ready~1
i think with some tweaking, you could get it to fit in nicely~1
i think with the plucked strings and the light chords you really balance well.~1
i think you and i will be having done fun on the future!  what a tune!~1
i think you could do without this small intro here, until about 12 seconds in~1
i think you could manipulate those vocals to some different notes, sort of descending, and it would be gnarly as hell~1
i think you guys are the next big thing~1
i think you have a bit too much compression in so it misses a bit power~1
i think you need to compress it harder because it's peaking, and you may want to notch it at 200hz to give your clap/snare more room~1
i think your work is cool man~1
i thought of this melody while i was in my local wave pool :p~1
i thought the track could use a hard break or perhaps a strong change up..there is a good structure and some interesting sounds in the track, for sure.~1
i thought the weakest track was probably presario, with the rest of the tracks being solid, with exception of come closer, and julius, julius being the strongest, and come closer being weaker than everything but presario imo.~1
i thought they were evil chipmunks 1st then i looked at the title - i still have trouble some times telling the difference between evil bunnies and evil chipmonks lol :d~1
i thought this was just a nice song to have...until 1:58 when my mind was blown!  great work!~1
i thought you were going to drop into the original, so would the listener~1
i told u i would notify u if i have time~1
i uploaded this track on youtube because i think more people should hear it and find you~1
i use a lot of sounds from famous artist~1
i use massive and reason and have most daws so its no problem :)~1
i use tabletop!!~1
i use your bootleg in my set! love it!~1
"i used it here:
http://popcorn.webmadecontent.org/x66

i want more cookie monster!! haha nice!~1
i want that snare ;-;~1
i want the full dl ;)~1
i want this sound in my phone!!!~1
i want this toon ._~1
i want to find a way to randomize the delay pattern, or take the nodes where the delay happens and randomize how wet it sounds~1
i want to go........~1
i want to hear more fx/noises~1
i want to scream and shot~1
i want to see live video how made.~1
i want to watch live video how made.~1
i warped the vocals to get them close to in time so that may have impacted the pitch a bit.~1
i was cracking up making it~1
i was in for the fnf campout from seattle~1
i was lookin for that earlier but sounds good.~1
i was losin my shit all over the place~1
i was movin the whole time during this~1
i was truly thinking of buying new ones :)~1
i was waiting for this.~1
i was wondering if i was just dreaming about his comment, but it still shows up on my phone haha~1
i was wondering what happend to you snoochiech.~1
i wasn't so sure about the song until the bass came in~1
i went~1
i went for a bit of dark chaos for max contrast with your track~1
i will be crankin this up for summer 2014 !!~1
i will be more than happy to check out your work.~1
i will be waiting your sweet reply soon~1
i will come see you play someday~1
i will download~1
i will keep checking your new stuff :) i've just got hold of ni komplete and ableton suite 8~1
i will repost all your work :)~1
i will take your criticisms into consideration! thanks for the support.~1
i will tho, sometime~1
i wish i could be as effortlessly commercial as you guys! i love your one family rap!!! xoxoxoxo~1
i wish i was there~1
i wish there was more bass~1
i wish there was more of us~1
i wish this kind of style get played more in my country~1
i wish those snare hits punched through harder and wer emore forward but i like her voice on this tempo a lot more than other remixes ive heard~1
i wish you very good luck in the competition =)~1
i won't comment on the dynamics just yet, as i know it's unmastered, but i am seriously looking forward to the completed piece.~1
i would add just a little more daft in between the drops here~1
i would be pleased ;-d but don't be bothered by me!~1
i would bring up the sounds because the bass is a bit overpowering~1
"i would definitely play this at a gig, love the combinations and sonic feel to it! maybe you should add some dirty harry lines like ""you feelin lucky punk""? "~1
i would do a better mastering job but good work ~1
i would have never thought to combine mario and dubstep, but you've done a great job!! keep up the good work!~1
i would have never thought to mix those sounds, but you pulled it off!~1
i would have rocked a pedal tone here, then the next phrase would have shifted to a different note~1
i would just work a ltl bit more on the single elements, the chords at the intro with an interesting reverb and some reverse effects would pump that into another dimension! for the rest, the drums has been worked in the best way possible.~1
i would kill to hear a neurofunk track from you, omni~1
i would listen to this in a foggy forrest in november or something.~1
i would love to drop this one, could you send me the wav file? (i only play wav)~1
i would love to get some feedback on some of my songs, and could you please post your song to my page here: www.facebook.com/spector.g ? i have a lot following that would love this~1
i would not mind dancing to this~1
i would not upload mixes if were you, as the mix doesn't only contain your music.~1
i would process the vocals more, but that's just me.~1
i would say everything is balanced sound wise, nice production~1
i would say your main piano line is a little too happy arpeggiating the second chord and that you should mix your drums louder to help them hit harder~1
i would so love to hear you live~1
i would still suggest turning up the vocal sample in the mix, it sounds interesting~1
i would suggest turning the piano sounding type synth down a little bit though~1
i would take some time and learn to crispen up your productions~1
i would tune the main parts a bit more but it's just me~1
i would use it for art projects~1
i would wana go to your concert/club nice work.~1
i would wash my car with this dirt! :d~1
i wouldn't call this prog house~1
i wouldn't have expected you to start a mix off so heavy!~1
i wub this! :d~1
i'd also look at adding a little more reverb to it, and perhaps even render and duplicate the pattern~1
i'd also notch the reese out around 500hz, and again at 4.5khz to get some of those harsh resonant sounds out of it~1
i'd bring up the drums a bit~1
i'd give that synth some more space to it~1
i'd just need to be able to download it.~1
i'd kick up the tempo to give it some power~1
i'd let the beat (or, just a, beat) run with the astral vox all the way to the end, but i admit its probably just my style thing~1
i'd like to ear that at the radio! great job and awesome quality!~1
i'd like to hear more of the vocal (rather than short samples)~1
i'd love to do a remix!~1
i'd personally do some more modulation and variation with things too, but i can tell you went for a progressive type feel~1
i'd say this drop would be better started with a heavy sound - a general thing, but it adds so much more impact~1
i'd suggest changing the genre here~1
i'd trip to this!~1
"i'd wish you ""good luck"" in osc, but you're one of the very few that actually don't need that, you're making your own luck with your music - doing a damn fine job :) thanks for the memories :)"~1
i'd work a bit more on this to get it really good :) just my oppinion of course ~1
i'll def give this some play~1
i'll do anything! i'll do anything!~1
i'll have to see what my other guy is up to!~1
i'll share your single around my twitter and facebook man! hope it blows up big~1
i'll teach you how to make this synth i used~1
i'll try my best to :) thanks!~1
i'm a big fan of your music.~1
"i'm a big fan of yours
"~1
i'm a dude made out of pills~1
i'm a fan of the original and now i'm a fan of this one~1
i'm a feeling this, everythimg is clear~1
i'm a huge fan of brutal dub but for some reason my favorite parts are your intro and outro.~1
i'm a new follower for sure~1
i'm a perfectionist, so every track that i make that i thouroghly exhaust any means of improvement on at that point at time, is perfect to me~1
i'm about to make 1,499 fb accounts to speed this up!  haha!  very nice!  if it gets opened before burning man, i'll drop it in a dj set!~1
i'm also liking your vocals~1
i'm buckling up though she sounds like a crazy driver~1
i'm crunching chips with the snare and i realized how sick this song is, its awesome!~1
i'm diggin on your choice of tracks~1

i'm loving this track.~1
i'm moist~1
i'm no pro at logic~1
"i'm not a big fan of d&b but this sounds like professional stuff to me :)
"~1
i'm not a huge techno guy, but there seems to be a lot of elements going on here~1
i'm not a huge trap person, but i always love your work..you are seriously a genius, especially if you can make me like a trap track~1
"i'm not all into minimal' but i can say that the mix is pretty good' accept the low end
"~1
i'm not crazy just cold blooded~1
i'm not sure if you did those or if they were part of the track~1
i'm not sure what track is what ..~1
i'm not the biggest fan of most house, but this one is definitely nice~1
i'm on it~1
i'm pretty busy lately what with having a new baby, but i've downloaded the .sunvox file and i might have a go with it   :)~1
i'm really diggin' the minimal sound your label represent~1
i'm really digging the synths and drums on this..~1
i'm really digging the trippy vibe of this song~1
i'm really enjoying the vibe on this one~1
i'm really feeling the openness in this tunes~1
i'm really liking this cool mix~1
i'm scared~1
i'm scurred.~1
i'm shinin' ho!~1

i'm studying jazz theory just for fun right now, so i'm getting all my bizarre chord progressions in a row!~1
i'm surprised in your new song really every time!!!your originality is too splendid!!!great job pikaaaaaa!!!~1
i'm tellin' ya, all you gotta do is get a manager and promote yourself better~1
i'm telling you man, it will not be long before you get your contract, these songs are fire!!!~1
i'm totally going to steal this...~1
i'm trying to think about how you made these groans but i've never honestly heard anything like that before~1
i'm trying to work more detail into things~1
i'm using massive~1
i'm very impressed with it~1
i've been droppin fear samples for years~1
i've been following your tutorials since the beginning~1
i've been loving every tune! fuck yeah!~1
i've been saved...~1
i've been thinking about that~1
i've checked out the rest of your songs and they're great, but this really stands out of the rest~1
i've found myself a new favourite song.#~1
i've heard a lot of these sounds in other songs, but you've organized them well here~1
i've listened to this five times today.~1
i've listened to this track about 500 times~1
"i've never been a fan of the ""four on the floor"" approach to edm but this definitely makes it fit with the complex rhythms surrounding it the beat just brings you back to reality for a minute"~1
"i've probably replayed the ""roots remixed"" part at least 20 times"~1
"i've released some tracks, but i really need more views, so people can know who i am! please give me som feedback for what you like and don't like :) i would also really appreciate if you shared the word about me :)

i57iim i6iik7ukj7 yh46h uj57u356 u5uj57 3 53 35~1
iam crazy..~1
iam feeling this ..nice intro~1
ice break here !~1
ice build up here!~1
ice produced once again a track from you~1
ich geh pennen~1
ich hor das set grade nochmal zum wach werden und bin noch mehr begeistert als gestern :) hoffe es wird ganz ganz viele ohren, mp3 player und auto-radios erreichen und glucklich machen~1
ich spreche kein deutsch, so hoffe ich, das macht sinn~1
ich werde warten dein sues antwort bald~1
"ich wurde ma sagen..!! ""der sommer kann kommen"" !!!! is echt geil das set...!!! weiter (so) machen ;)"~1
icredible ;)~1
id ?~1
id b gettin down ~1
id be curious to see how it would sound with a different waveform than modern talking~1
id bump this all the time~1
id drop this track of sure~1
id go for a different bassline~1
id incorporate a bigger build and drop into this tune mate as there is , i feel alot of potential with what you already have here! ~1
id live to see a bit more edge and filtering but thats just my opnion.~1
ideas are there, i just think you need to work on your choice of leads and bass~1
idk about a song about aids tho lol~1
idk whats happening~1
idk why but i need it.~1
idol.~1
if a party doesn't break out where you're playing this, you're playing in a morgue~1
if aliens he'll bent on destroying earth came just play this would scare the space pants off em....they'd soon fook off back !!!~1
if cannibal corpse made dubstep~1
if complextro and dnb had a baby, this would be their beautiful offspring.~1
if i could get some vocals i would try this.~1
if i could just learn how to make em...~1
if i were going to rework it at all, i'd dial the noise down a few db and maybe reduce the number of overlapping tracks by a couple so the listener can focus on the amazing glitch work you've done throughout this piece, and the db you subtract from the noise, i would add onto the beat to 'brighten' or increase the jumpiness of the overall mix.~1
if kick and snare are really ni massive than make tutorial!!!~1
if only the `masses` had half the energy of this jon ..~1
if only this song was 5 times as long so i didnt have to listen to it on repeat! haha~1
if that happened, i would know that i am starting to be heard out there~1
if that makes any sense~1
if that makes any sense lol.~1
if the ricter!!!!~1
if the world doesn't end or the power grid shuts down~1
if there wasn't a title i would never know the original song, it's so much different.~1
if this ever gets public access, delete my fanboy comments off it! ha ha~1

"in germany we would say: ""krass""
this is butter :)"~1
in love <3~1

in love..wow and just in the beginning~1
in my head i guess i was thinking orchestral, but it could also be great with more developed synth sounds~1
in my neighborhood we say : foda pra caralho!!!!! animal !!!! casca grossa!!!!!  well done cowboy rex~1
in my oppinion the intro is faaaar too long, normally a dubstep track drops at 0:55 or 1:22.~1

instead of a fade in, maybe go a bit more of a broken beat, and then drop straight into the drum n bass kick sequence..i like it, just think you could get more bang for your buck~1

interesting transition....~1
interesting tune you got going on here, unfortunately it's not something i would listen to, but i appreciate the quality of production you got going on~1
interesting tune, some pretty cool synths in there~1
interesting vocals~1
interesting way how you've mixed it into the groove so you cut away most of the piano 'hit' of the start of the note, sounds really cool :) very polished track~1
interesting work man~1
interesting! :d~1
interesting, i am not a huge fan of that alarm noise~1
interesting.~1
interisting way of crossing genre~1
international feel !~1
intersting slow down in rhythm~1
"interviewer: how do you feel about the success of your incredible new track ""dubstep ""wreckingball"""" "~1
intresting sound, loving this great buildup and drop :)~1

intro is classic instantly ~1
intro is good and everything from the drums and all is just real original~1
intro is pretty sick!~1
intro track is money~1
intro track levels from my main man from the uk super producer tadi the great peep him on sc too https://soundcloud.com/tadithegreat~1

is a blessing to have you here!~1
is a good job :d~1
is a great dj~1
is a no vocals version on the way? ~1
is amazing,is very good congratulations~1
is any of this copyright?~1
is awesome and the whole track is just brilliant ...~1
is das fett ey~1
is dope boom~1
is dow tempo!~1
is good to see your stil rocking around..~1
is it called substep because you drop the bass so far? :d~1
is it real guitar ? ;o~1
is it too simple for you?:~1
is ja wohl mal absolut geil~1
is like robot porn sounds~1
is okay , got a lot of different sounds , but just needed a bit more eqing to balance the frequency .~1
is she a vergin or what :)~1
is sick.~1
is tha koan i hear?~1
is that a sample of someone saying boom?~1
is that massive?~1
is that pulp fiction?~1
is there another download?~1
is this a new soundcloud account? there's no way you only have 46 suscribers~1
is this a vocal sample or an original verse for the song?~1
is this for a comp...or did you just remix it? its good either way  80)~1
is this mastered?~1
is this on itunes i can't find it ~1
is this thenew psy song?~1
is this what getting high feels like?~1
"is very good :d
"~1
isla - your touch~1
isn't that how it's supposed to be?~1
isssssssaaaaaaaa~1
it :)~1
it a guud mix.~1
it all feels very looped~1
it could use a better choice of sample's but smooth mixing, keep at it!~1
it could use a few tweaks here and there to get the vocals leveled with the track~1
it could use an extra synth? more spice perhaps?~1
it creates a nice atmosphere~1
it dadditon~1
it definitely has that cosmic feel, and somewhat reminds me of some old games i've played like star fox~1
it doesn t feel good in the end~1
it doesn't sound too much, which is good, and i really like the synth/bass that comes in on almost every beat.~1
it feel good  geeaaaaa~1
it feels like it's lacking a little in the low end though which would provide the track a bit more substance~1
it feels so old school and ahead of it time!!! i love you and thank you so much!!!!~1
it feels very relaxing, yet upbeat~1
it felt like hardstyle but then it became dub.~1
it gets even better when the break kicks in with the buildup and the vocals..just awesome shit~1
it goes great with the beat coming up~1
it got nice groove too.~1
it has a breakbeat feel to it i really dig~1
it has a nice melodic texture and it progresses nicely~1
it has a very fast pace about it~1
it has all those crazy arpeggios, but i don't count those~1
it has some like house and some kind of 80's vibe about it~1
it has to be hard..~1
it hit a concrete wall that forms part of an emergency access section head-on, in a tunnel where the speed limit is 100km/h (62 mph)~1
it immediately captured my attention~1
it is a little quiet though, but still sounds sick as shiat!~1
it is amazing~1
it is dreamy and i could see it in a film or something similar.~1
it is not a tack i play live.~1
it is not mastered bro ~1
"it is now ""away"""~1
it is overdirty for me ) oversick compilation!!!! dope!~1
it is so catchy~1
it is still way too long mate, anything over 6 minutes as an original mix needs to be seriously cut down/ other than that really like it :d~1
it is truely beautiful~1
it isn't that complex or technical of a track..~1
it just came out that way,  never planned :)~1
it just hits the right notes at the right time..~1
it just so happened to work really well on that mixdown..~1
it kind of sounds like one from swedish house mafia~1
it made my weeks ;o~1
it maide me scrame end shot it is osowmeeeeee~1
it makes it epic! ~1
it makes me feel alive~1
it makes me wanna mo0o0o0o0oveeee~1
it makes me wanna move?! fuck.~1
it makesss me wanna mooooveee!!!!~1
it need some modifications to really fit with what i want to give in it~1
it really brings you into the track at the beginning~1
it really punches you in the face~1
it really put a little smirk on my face!~1
it really puts me in a trance~1
it remembers me on the works from https://soundcloud.com/bryzone~1
it s not just tribal , it s like based on the tribe , instead of just dubstep with perc ~1
it said check back later.~1
it seems like house-music has a tendency to be quite monotonous, which is something that i kind of get tired of after a while~1
it seems like martin garix's sounds ! yeah ~1
"it seems that the law on driving and rest periods has been respected.""
both the drivers were among the dead"~1
it smells size records !!!~1
it so sick~1
it sound like something you would hear on the radio~1
it sounds good~1
it sounds great in 128~1
it sounds just like you have a track on each deck and keep pushing the crossfader over randomly.~1
it sounds like shes saying fap..~1
it sounds like the kick is completely panned to the right~1
it sounds like virtual riot~1
"it sounds rather ""disconnected"" from the rest of the track, that can be either a good or a bad thing."~1
it sounds real good~1
it sounds really good and the vibe is perfect!~1
it sounds really muffled, could be the bitrate~1
it sounds so cool~1
it sounds very good, and brings a lot of adrenaline at the drop, but try to be original, you could find the next big thing :)~1
it squeezes last drop of sweat from my hardware and rigth now it's unplayable~1
it still is amazing.~1
it takes away from the drop if you have the the main synths come in to early~1
it takes time.~1
it tickles my ears...~1
it totally saved my slow decline and kept me going until sunday night!!~1
it transport you into a world miles away from hear .~1
it was a great party~1
it was a great party and sold out, so crowdy crowdy~1
it was a great party, and the subs from this set are still buzzing in my head :)~1
it was a little too old fashioned for me, i love van halen but i just dont think the two fit well together.~1
it was a surprise for me ~1
it was already a relaxing song, so i wanted to keep it the same~1
it was an awesome party bro.~1
it was awesome to hear your track on this ridiculousley big soundsystem!!! one of my phattest tracks of my set.~1
it was awesome working on this song and video with @ill-esha, full ep in the works!~1
it was cool you were there man~1
it was good mixing though~1
it was great but now it is amazing!~1
it was mostly planned (and we rarely do that, but fnf's important!) so remembering the improv parts was easy peasy.~1
it was supposed to be a ride cymbal, but it came out better.~1
it worked!  thanks for the comment.~1
it would be cool if you could incorporate more of the video game sounds into your bass patterns, that would really be cool~1
it would be perfect for a nice side-platform game~1
it would be really great thanks~1
it wouold really hammer home the chorus the second time it drops!~1
it'd sound freakin' sick!~1
"it's a ""yeah"" track for sure.."~1
it's a bit calming, which contrasts the rest of your song~1
it's a bit to choppy for my taste~1
it's a bit too loud~1
it's a bit too minimal imo, but the sounds we're clear and crispy, so that's a matter of taste, not quality:d~1
it's a good choice for a prominent percussive element~1
it's a nice break from all the action.~1
it's a quick and easy way to get a good frenetic baseline for your pattern~1
it's a tradeoff..~1
it's a trap!~1
it's a trap! i love it! the mix, the flow, the groove, nice! ~1
it's a very different sound for my but i admit this is have very good sound!~1
it's about house!!!~1
it's about time you making more music ~1
it's all good but i miss something like a bass in the frequencies between the kik and the synths.~1
it's almost like a battle of what you want to do versus your conscience, and desire seems to winning out~1
it's alright~1
it's alright man, good mastering!~1
it's always so hard to comment on your tracks patchy~1
it's amazing what lmms can do.~1
it's an interesting beginning~1
it's awesome!~1
it's beast.~1
"it's called  ""the incoming"" go take a look on my sounds :)"~1
it's catchy and interesting, it would be better if you turned up the master volume a bit~1
it's clipping a lot~1
it's cool really catchy but it needs more switch ups and changes in the melody~1
it's cool, but it feels empty to me~1
it's currently my favorite dubstep track~1
it's definitely allowed, nothing but feldspar and free plugins :)~1
it's different than most dnb songs i have heard~1
it's great how wide your sound gets here.~1
it's grooving, but i think the sound design could be a bit more interesting, vocal is a little distorted for my taste as well~1
it's gucci!~1
"it's in the same key, there may be some ""accidentals"" here and there"~1
it's just nice ~1
it's like an orgasm in my ears lol~1
it's like being traped inside the ice station~1
it's like dubstep & electronic mixed together, i like =^-^=~1
it's more dubstep than anything.~1
it's my favorite part of the track~1
it's not bad man! just not great...~1
it's not easy to consistently produce  hits in any genre but to do so across many is rare~1
it's not my remix, so its got to go where you want to and i have large respect for that~1
it's ok~1
it's okay i guess~1
it's okay, it's not really in time with actual beat~1
it's perfect from beginning to end~1
it's perfect to dance..~1
it's pretty cool~1
it's punchy, but it sounds thin.~1
it's quite energetic and uplifting~1
it's really chopped up and unique~1
it's sad because its medolic.~1
it's so mister grey! lol nice work!~1
"it's so simple to make but it is defenetly the best!!
realy nice track btw, i've heard the intro from the livestream but the drop is really really nice!  awsome"~1
it's so slow but it's so cool~1
it's so..~1
it's summer release! ;~1
it's the best so far...~1
it's the intro of my new mixtape : http://soundcloud.com/gamz/gamz-holdemix~1
it's very ingenious your track that's a good idea, i like all harmony and thi is be full of sounds great!~1
it's well done bro, but the original is simly to epic itself ;)~1
its a banger~1
its a bit odd, but it all fits together pretty smoothly :)~1
its a bit out the world to me, but for sure people will like it mate! just a matter of creation, good luck!~1
its a club smasher mate, well done :d~1
its a good one~1
its a good production and the mix is clean but its repetitive~1
its a good transition track.~1
its a mashup ?~1
its a pretty original!! this song has been remixed so much, but this sounds dope!~1
its a really good synth but the low end sounds like its clipping a bit or slamming into hardcore compression~1
its a really good tune mate.~1
its a representation of the last 12 years of my life~1
its abstract~1
its actually more alternative and indy and dubstep pop~1
its always the same~1
its amazing ~1
its amazing.~1
its an amazing song but 76.7 mb's???!!!~1
its another classic..loving the backign vocals, and how chill the whole tune is, soo big my man..~1
its awesome :)~1
its awesome sounding and laid back.~1
its awsome bro !!~1
its carzy good main part:)~1
its cinda a sad song don't know why xd~1
its coming this friday~1
its coming...~1
its crackling a little but i really enjoy the beach front vibes.~1
its cummmming~1
its get kinda boring, because it's like the same, through the hole song~1
its good~1
its good for only being made in 3 hours.~1
its good to see other musicians taking a risk with their music~1
its got a really nice and catchy melody~1
its grrrrrrrrrreat!~1
its insane~1
its just too much of the same thing, its not fun to listen too~1
its like angels singing~1
its like multiple track parts after eachother lol great build up xd ~1
its nice but just keep your beats high and a bit fast! cheers:)~1
its no one above you, nor beside you~1
its not ad~1
its not the best, but it'll do :)~1
its ok~1
its old skool soundin!  reminds me of my tampa days!~1
its pretty cool, but the drums could variate a lil more with this genre, but thats just what i think, this is great though~1
its pretty original, though i think the composition could use a little more variation~1
its real great ~1
its real grimey yet it still has a pretty solid drum beat~1
its really good :)~1
its really hard to do everything all alone :(~1
its really nice bro !~1
its samba :)~1
its shit~1
its short and to the point~1
its sick tho ...~1
its skrillex~1
its stupid~1
its taking a long time to finish because the plugins im using is making my cpu freeze up~1
its the doctor p - superbad sound and flux pavilion high pitched sound~1

love your tracks dude! respect!!~1
love your work~1
love your work man, really classic stuff, just curious, if you dont do this already, you should try layering a straight bass line with no fx underneath your wobbles, itl make them that much deeper and the bass note will sit nicely in the mix beneath any pitch bends and whatnot you do with the mid/high wobbles, make sure you eq it though so your other sounds still cut through, and keep up the great work man~1
love! <3~1

"~1
mauu~1
max downloads reached, check the description for download.~1
max!!!~1
may i ask...~1
may this sound be use on video in exchange for atributte? daymare (ft~1
may well be the best kickdrum in the whole challenge~1
mayad bro~1
maybe 30 mins worth of messing around while getting paid, so maybe not so big of a fail?~1
maybe a littl better masstering but noot that bad~1
maybe a little verb on his voice.~1
maybe a solo lead will fit in here?~1
maybe a sub - bass re- eq ? ~1
maybe abit of reverb on the drums more eg high hats!!~1
maybe add a lead in the drop~1
maybe add a slight sidechain compression on the bells, duck them a little to make the drums sound clearer through the mix..~1
maybe add some more overlaying synths ~1
maybe another kick bro?~1
maybe bass line may be deeper but i like this track anyway :)~1
maybe brighten it up a little by raising it around the 3k mark.~1
maybe could have a used a tad more bass.~1
maybe i'll get an official when they get back together! lol~1
maybe in a mix or something~1
maybe it'd be better when i'd combine that~1
maybe it's my headphones? but this is super dope creative~1
maybe its just me but it seems kinda low but other than that its a great track~1
maybe its just my messed up hearing.~1
maybe leave out the kickdrum and finish it with some beatdrop, or.., or try some kind of kick-based build-up? ..;)~1
maybe mess around with that high pitch synth to it~1
maybe movie theme :)~1
maybe once i've exhausted my ears listening to it on repeat i'll get down to it~1
maybe scrounge around logic for something like that~1
maybe separately but i just wasn't impressed as i usually am.~1
maybe sidechaining that sustaining string  will give it more movement~1
maybe some alteration with the bass here~1
maybe some compression in the right spots.~1
maybe some more fills or fx sweeps to help push it along?~1
maybe that's cliche, idk haha..~1
maybe try adding a breakdown instead of bridge~1
maybe try using a hp filter at first and then sweeping down when the rest of the percussion comes in.~1
maybe we could play a show together sometime? haha ~1
maybe work on the overall mixdown~1
maybe you could layer some drum noises and make it sound a lil more full~1
mayne i need to take a break before i blow these speakers~1
mcm smthing wierd dsni~1

normally i dont like trap but man u let me think different it sounds awesome nice effects that arent to much!~1
normally i would destroy anyone who tried to mess with but nirvana but you really pulled it off~1
"not ""he is"""~1
not 100% sold on the lead sound but top work~1
not a bad attempt~1
not a bad mix, but a lot could be improved~1
not a bad rendition of the old school drum n bass track..~1
not a bad track man.~1
not a bad track, bit repetative, becomes kinda predictable, could do with more variation~1
not a big fan of techno, but you killed this one~1
not a big fan of that type of music, but love the swing in it =) ~1
not a big fan of the vocals but the melody is niceee!~1
not a fan~1
not a fan of the lead but its nice sound.~1
not a fan of the style but production is great!~1
not a fan of trap but some of these songs are animal savage~1
"not a genre i'm too familiar with, so take my comment with a grain of salt! 
the mix itself is great, though the vocals could've a bit more crisp in the quality"~1
not a huge fan of dubstep, but this is a pretty tolerable song selection~1
not bad :)~1
not bad at all~1
not bad at all :)~1
not bad at all :) ~1
"not bad at all man....cool bass, melody, synths
"~1
not bad at all!~1
not bad at all, although the drop seems slightly too sliced and glitched...~1
not bad at all..~1
not bad bro i like it nice mixing and everything~1
not bad bro.~1
not bad but it sounds very dry overall~1
not bad but this synth combined with your description made me lol~1
not bad dude ;-)~1
not bad dude, but you can work out more on the presets, and good mastering, try to make it huge..~1
not bad fellas~1
not bad for a bootleg! i like the windups and the drops.~1
not bad for rb~1
not bad i like the build up~1
not bad man~1
not bad man nice drop~1
not bad the intro is a little to plain for my likings, but all in all great job~1
not bad this bit like~1
not bad this track!!~1
not bad tune :)~1
not bad!~1
not bad!  i really like the builds, could use a bit more drums though.~1
not bad! :p~1
"not bad, but it kinda feels like it still needs some ""umph"" it's not really that ""grabbing"" "~1
not bad, i'm liking what you're trying to do here, however the levels seem to be off abit, try adjusting those~1
not bad, kinda dig it.~1
not bad, love the clubby feel it has~1
not bad, not bad at all~1
not bad, preffered the beginning ~1
not bad, production is okay, could do with a melody though, something to liven it up a bit~1
not bad, really hq techno ;-)~1
not bad, some random noises though~1
not bad, when you use the vocals after the drop try cutting all the sounds to intensify everything~1
not chicken tho...~1
not combro lho ;d!! ....~1
not dubstep cool bass though~1
"not enough balls, but pretty and ""pink"""~1
not far from my own work ;)~1
not feelin the constant predictablity~1
not fight aliens~1
not first~1
not good~1
not listened to you in ages ...~1
not much a fan of house music but this made me bob my head~1
not my choice of snares, but the synth sounds are topnotch~1
not my favorite genre but you have all the stuff there, good job putting this together, sounds clean~1
not my kind of music, but not bad at all~1
not my style but interesting still~1
not my style but its a good mix!~1
not my style but this was cool to listen~1
not necessarily my style of electronic music, but i'm definitely digging it nonetheless~1
not normally my thing but enjoyed the track~1
not original...~1
not progressive house'~1
not really a fan of techno but you got some good stuff here! love the drums and synths ~1
not really a fan to be honest ~1
not really for me.~1
"not really like sounds but still cool ;)
"~1
not really my taste but good production i guess!~1
not really my thing , way to much going on in the song~1
not really wantin to move to this track maybe change the tempo~1
not sure i have a remixer ..but would like to do a remix for ya.~1
not sure if gusta....it's just very weird~1
not sure if i am crazy about the fade in but the arrangement and drop is tight~1
not sure if this should be titled as a house track, but very killer indeed~1
not sure the genre but those drums are spectacular!!~1
not terrible, but enough to be noticeable~1
not that big skrillex fan but this remix rocks!~1
not that good actually~1
not that the song is bad now ;) just my pov.~1
not the sample, but thanks for the info :)~1
not this right here my ni gga, this is dope~1
not to bad~1
not to overpowered with sounds., nice~1
not to shabby hubby x~1
not too shabby my friend~1
not ur traditional remix~1
not usually a fan of mixes, but i love these jams~1
not white its mor like.........~1
"note to all who call me a k391 ""faker"" on dropthatcats promo page but the thing is,i have no intentions in competing with k391,or other artists for that matter,i love k391's im not a ""faker"" i am just inspired by his music and wish to create tracks similar to the genre"~1
nothing like a nice groovy deep house song~1
notice the volume peaks in spots even on your sc waveform you can see it~1

"prime minister elio di rupo - who also travelled to switzerland on wednesday - told reporters in sion that is was ""an absolutely tragic day"" for belgium"~1
primo you crazy.~1
pro #1, its good~1
prob!!!!!~1
probably easiest to just make a dropbox folder, right?  some .wav files all starting at measure 0 would be easiest~1
probably my favorite rap/dub mix, goodjob~1
probably very well suited for a vocal due to its minimal nature...if no vocal then i would like to see it climb a little in momentum in a few stages...just to bring it to life..either with percussion or simply an element or two~1
probe unos antes de encontrar estos drums dulces~1
problem ?~1
produced really well!~1
production is pretty good as well!~1
productions on this record is very dope maybe could have used a better mix because i can't understand the lyrics~1

thas a girl cumming hear her? she go (a a a a a a a )~1
"that 808 and drop drums remind me of ""fallout"""~1
that ambient bass with the reverb...yessss~1
that arp and low shriek don't quite gel.~1
that awkard moment where there is no more room to your comment~1
that back and forth between the bass and high synths are brilliant! ~1
that bass is f---ing heavy~1
"that bass is sick!
http://soundcloud.com/djderp-2"~1
that bass is so filthy its not funny! love it!~1
that bass is too much!~1
that bass line is kickin.~1
that bass line is very clean its sitting with that kick in a good way~1
that bass sounds awesome, loving this intro~1
that bass vocal sounds kinda wedged in there, maybe just use it once if at all and don't loop it~1
that bass, is so legit.nice work dudes.~1
that bassline is sweet, i think the ovocals could be a bit more clear but this is catchy!~1
that beat !! so fat dude love this wow !~1
that beat intro is sick!~1
that beat is sick! really big track man~1
that beat is very nice, you can make a whole song with that!~1
that beat!!!!!!!~1
that beggin-strips dog is bound to be one happy mother f'r.~1
that being said, i think the track is great, and you did a great job!~1
that bouild is dope~1
that breakdown, on point~1
that bronson ? haha nice mental mix ~1
that build doe~1
that build up and drop paid off really well~1
that clap is sweet~1
that click work~1
that creepy vibe given off by the song gives me shivers every time.~1
that drop~1
that drop doe!~1
that drop is fatter than that booty.~1
that drop is so awesome im a big fan of house music keep up the good work greetings from greece love the kick and snare you used on this production makes me dance :d~1
that drop maan~1
that drop takes me places and the traditiniol dub stab is perfect on this track, very complex sounds~1
that drop tho~1
that drop was like a kick, right in my mouth! hell yeah!~1
that drop was nasty~1
that drop was so messy, but i fucking loved it~1
that drop! sooo clean but too repetitive needs more like the samples for sure~1
that drop!!! :d :d~1
that drop...~1
that drops banging! into it!~1
that drum and bassline is something serious! nice work! loveing that drop~1
that fast past synths sounds amazing  untop of the panning hats!! love it when it kicks in with the piano keys sounds amazing so far mate~1
that filter was sick af :3~1
that first drop is dope! vocal samples are nice~1
that flow...you sirs did well! ~1
that fucking baseline and synth lead is massive! didn't think any other versions could be as good as the original.~1
that fucking good :)~1
that fucking snare all, like, compressed until it sounds all hollow-like~1
that guitar tho~1
that had a trance style anti-climax there, it went smooth~1
that hard kick is fucking sweet~1
that hard!!!!~1
that harmony, wow ..~1
that hh sounds good.~1
that high synth is a bit too upfront and the hat roll isnt quite as quick and abstract as it needs to be! the samples youve used are also in a bunch of different tracks~1
that intro is so cool, killer way to start the track! ~1
that intro, so nice! such a chilled track, loving this :}~1
that is a bit quiet~1
that is a marvelous rise and drop~1
that is art~1
that is filthy man~1
that is good..~1
that is just awesome!!!~1
that is lovely and brutal bass!~1
that is one hell of a build into one massive drop sir!!! kudos!!~1
that is one hell of a drop!~1
that is some really strong bass~1
that is sooo damn smoooth~1
that jazz and jive type feel put into the dance~1
that kick is deep as fuck~1
that kick is so low it makes ball hair vibrate~1
that kick o_0~1
that lead could use a bit more reverb, but great production overall ~1
that lead synth on the off beat is clean too great layers man!~1
"that low sound is tits! its like a hard i and then a ""ugh"" love it"~1
that make all dancefloor jump~1
that means people who had lite or solo get a free upgrade without paying any more and people who had lite get more benefits :d~1
that melody! nice~1
that moment before an awesome drop...~1
that music rockz~1
that outro c;~1
that pad in the background man...~1
that part and the breaks are downright awesome! drop is really nice too, just don't like the exagerated amount of that high pitched bass lead in the drops~1
that part tickled~1
that percussive synth riff/melody is just really groovy and catchy~1
that piano right there alone brings me back to the 90's even the vocals~1
that piano track is dope! i do wish it changed up a little bit you make it work real well adding in the bells~1
that pink panther bass!!!~1
that pitch bend.nice touch.~1
that pulse the kick is creating is real dope almost an atmosphere in itself~1
that reverb sounds good on the stab synth~1
"that right there
<3"~1
that rythm is catchy..~1
that s really too much - even for progressive sound~1
that sample would prob be better with a dnb kick~1
that set was great!~1
that shit cray~1
that shit is cray mister gray~1
that should be a fade in not just a sound drop and put right into the next part~1
that snare ! ~1
that snare + drop are so complicated to think! cause its so awesome,and that vocal are so skrillex style excellent job!~1
that snare is criminal~1
that snare is good but its not cutting throught the mix enough~1
that snare is way too dry if you ask me, throw some reverb on it, make it a little fatter~1
that snare!!! oh god that is fricken powerful :d~1
that song took a turn what an unexpected sick drop~1
that sound in the pads are intense!~1
that sound it sick, that synth~1
that sound wouldn't work in fl studio -_-~1
that sound..~1
that sounds so good dude!~1
that style is hottttttttt!!!~1
that syncopated wub man fuck that's awesome~1
that synth could use a little more eq in the mid-high area for me~1
that synth is tight~1
that synth need some work to push in to that voltage smoothly :)~1
that synth pad is badman~1
that synth work is ba ba banging~1
that talking synth is heavy as f***! very skrillex sounding~1
that teamfight such amazing *__*~1
that tempo man, what bpm are you at?~1
that thing in the cellar is not my mother!~1
that thing with the tape delay is insane!!! very good bootleg mate ~1
"that track = bomb!
"~1
that unique patchy style comes thru with the goods once again !! ,, realy nice brother , sounds realy underground ,, some train sounds would be coool aswell :)  keep em comming brother ,!!~1
that violin! awesome!!~1
that vocal is awesome~1
that vocal sample (i think) is really a nice touch!~1
"that vocal that comes in reminds me of the guy who says ""face down a$$ up thats the way we like to f*ck"""~1
that voice, bass and beat are so well fitting together!~1
that wah-wah :)  nice track, good luck~1
that was a good track~1

that wobble bass is sick man great work on this the transitions are flawless ~1
that works nice man~1

that' s so heavy! thanks a lot!~1
"that's ""the sound"" of modern progressive trance, though"~1
that's a crazy dirty ride~1
that's a crazy drop and the first time i heard someone use a sample to do it too!~1
that's a good rmx!!~1
that's a great mix michael, great work reworking this out here~1
that's a great track, right here!, what's the title? i think your mixing skill is top class, really a great mix with a good mix between each track, so you really feel it's a good dj behind the turntables!~1
that's a huge mix~1
that's a mean sound you have in there~1
that's a sick beat, son~1
that's a wicked stuff, mate! trippy industrial tune ~1
that's beautiful !~1
"that's common in this genre, but you really want to stand out, ya know?
"~1
that's definitely different, lovely drop.~1
that's my opinion of course, but either way this is a very well executed mix~1
that's my shit!~1
that's my style!~1
that's nice! nice sound, good mixing!~1
that's old-men-trance ;)~1
that's one hot track! :3~1
that's probably what you were going for anyways.~1
that's right .~1
that's right!!!!!~1
that's so so good i love it~1
that's swagging!~1
that's that heat sun nice ~1
that's the drop i was waiting for!~1
that's the drum-n-bass i like~1
that's the natural order~1
that's the outro of dat saintsfan gta v youtube channel~1
that's what  like about it~1
that's what's sup sho-t~1
thats a big drop! holy crap nice melody~1
thats a cool tune~1
thats a coolsynth..~1
thats a fat synth right there!~1
thats a good beginning and the song sounds great into it but you've got pianos that sound so loud.~1
thats a great bootleg and im defently gonna use it~1
thats a great track i feel it!~1
thats a jam~1
thats a pretty awesome combination of all the really pretty stuff in the background and the crazy dubstep sounds  at the same time~1
thats a sick drop! ~1
thats a ton of bass~1
thats a top ten bassline~1
thats a very cool part here..~1

thats soothin~1
thats the dropstuff~1
thats unique, and really workin~1
thats very sick beats man!!!!~1
thats wat i was wait for~1
thattt dropppppppppp~1
"the ""chorus"" is so trippy."~1
"the ""dub"" is excellent.."~1
"the ""instrumentation"" reminds me of ""artful dodger"" slightly!!!"~1
"the ""lead"" is very unique too"~1
"the ""ma-a-a-a-ack-le-more"" made the original for me - 2 minutes of it makes this mix for me"~1
the 'swing' is a little robotic~1
the 24 injured have been taken to hospitals in sion, bern and lausanne~1
the added effects help.~1
the airy noise in the background that is sidechained is nice but a wee bit too loud or may even need some eq otherwise nice intro loving the electro touch!~1
the ambient sounds really moves that along~1
"the ambients are really well done, sounds like you used my favourite plugin ""harmless"" maybe not, but it's really well used in this track"~1
the amount pf heavy in dat bass~1
the are nice too .~1
the arp is a great sound, and i really like the way you've used it, especially with the notes you choose~1
the arp melody is captivating..~1
the arpeggiated textures are cool, and the melody is nice, although i feel it could do even more, possibly move to other chords or something~1
the arpy chimes in here sound nice~1
the atmosphere is great here~1
the b assline is amazing~1
the balance could be improved, but otherwise, the mastering is pretty well done.~1
the base it's not bad but it's a little bit repetitive!~1
the bass and drums are good, except it sounds like a needs a bit more stuff, maybe some pads, some fx, accompanying synth textures, but yeah still good though, just needs work :)~1
the bass and nyc compression is beautiful in this one~1
the bass and shit.~1
the bass compression seems kinda fart-ish but i can deal with that~1
the bass hits hard on my headys~1
the bass in this is great man, nice vibe all the way~1
the bass is nice and that brass synth is cool too!~1
the bass is quite good!~1
the bass is sick!~1
the bass is so full and rich~1
the bass is so punchy~1
the bass is too bitty~1
the bass needs a bit of work, gotta switch it up a bit more, but i like what you've got so far! good preview, good start~1
the bass synth is a little repetative, the song could use some more elements, but the groove is definitely there~1
the bass synths are huge...lots of sound~1
the bass synths remind me of a much heavier sounding feed me.~1
the bass woooo yes~1
the bass work is really cool~1
the bassline is really dope, congrats~1
the bassline itself makes it feel like a game or action scene~1
the bassline sounds like it might be out of key with the chimes on top~1
the beat is a bit too much like goa for me, but thats just my opinion :) good work!~1
the beat is banging and i am to!~1
the beat is different and the piano melody is catchy! the drop gets the track nice and bouncy too~1
the beat is infectious~1
the beat is really well done too~1
the beat is super cool sounding love the the synths take you on a mission~1
the beat killin it~1
the beat on this >>>>~1
the beat sounds broken into like little micro chips~1
the beats are pretty cool with the electronic sounds, and nice bouncy bouncy synth :)~1
the beginning here sounds very empty, maybe some drums here would be better, otherwise great work man!~1
the beginning was too calm, but the kick and the beat made it better, sound great!~1
the belgian foreign ministry said most of the children were aged around 12, and the bus was one of three hired by a christian group~1
the bell sounds cool~1
the bells/hang drum sound is fantastic!!! and im lovin the trap-style hat roll! great work man~1
the bening was the same for alittle to long but once it kind of switched up it was pretty good~1
the best of the best!~1
the best part~1
the best song ever !!!! =d~1
the best song from k.t.n :d~1
the best sounding part of the track is right here, clean and well defined.~1
"the best track ever :d
"~1
the best!~1
the best!! no more words! impress all your good work~1
the best!!!! good work!!!~1
the boss incoming!~1
the bounce to the bum-bum-beat, really enjoyable!~1
the bouncy beginning is the just intro to this house anthem, it just leads the way to a pure dance track worthy of clubs.~1
the break down and the vocals go very well~1
the breakdown is nicely made, and you transition beautifully into the drums, only to take them out again, great way of adding impact to the drop, which is really more towards chill instead of heavy dubstep~1
the breakdown seemed a little plain at the start, kinda took a while to warm up.~1
the build up was great tho and then the drop..~1
the buildup on this track got me expecting a lot bigger peak, and i didn't really get that~1
"the bus crashed shortly after 21:00 (20:00 gmt) on <b><a href=""http://www.comelygirls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">women slipper</a><b> tuesday near sierre, in the swiss canton of valais, close to the border with italy"~1
"the children had spent a week <b><a href=""http://www.comelygirls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">adidas zx 500</a><b> skiing in val d'anniviers in the swiss alps"~1
the children on the bus were wearing seat belts and no other vehicle was involved, he added~1
the chimes should lose some low end eq when the bass comes in, at any rate.~1
the claps are eqed perfectly here man, really contribute to the entire tune and make it come alive man good job! ~1
"the coach, carrying 52 <b><a href=""http://www.comelygirls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brassiere</a><b> people back to belgium following a skiing trip, struck a wall in a tunnel on tuesday"~1
the contrast between the synth and the piano is frickin awesome!~1
the crystal has been dropped!~1
the d/l isn't working any more :((~1
the dark side ! :)~1
the decisions was easy...i choose to like your track :d awesome~1
the delivery of the vocals is nice and rhythmic, the transitions are a little weird~1
the different instruments and noises sound awesome~1
the distorted sounding kick is in a good way, this sounds like going on a train really fast ~1
the dorp is mint to man, such a good job~1
the download link isn't working anymore, could you update a new download link ? :)~1
the drop choice with the synth is just spot on~1
"the drop happens rather suddenly and unexpectly, maybe put a bridge before that break down slightly
"~1
the drop is amazing :)~1
the drop is awesome after this huge build up~1
the drop is chilled out and melodies~1
the drop is dope, keys and aptmos are also slick~1
the drop is good to as the drums go well with your leads on it~1
the drop is just amazing~1
the drop is pretty intense and consistent not bad ~1
the drop is really good!~1
the drop is so intense!~1
the drop is too strong for the nice and chill intro~1
the drop just seems to happen and i can't hear any sort of sub bass~1
the drop of drops~1
the drop reminds me of adventure club! nice job man :)~1
"the drop went on beat bro 
but plz check out my new single track  free your mind plz comment share  nd show some feeback thanks u"~1
the drum break is energetic and this sounds great.~1
the drum game is on point too!~1
the drum sounds are weak , but the rest of da track is realy good ~1
the drum work is top notch~1
the drumming is extremely strong...i like that~1
the drums and percussion work good together to get a nice rythm~1
the drums are bangin bro epic~1
the drums are hard as steel~1
the drums are not coming in through the mix enough for my liking~1
the drums are on point and the other sounds work really nicely around them with true mastering great stuff !~1
the drums are tight.~1
the drums are very crisp and clear, they have lots of bite and snap to it~1
the drums are waaaay to loud...~1
the drums are well done and move the track along nicely~1
the drums here are insane~1
the drums hit hard and pound from start to finish, nice us eof the obscure sound bites as well~1
the drums in here are really strong they carry the track nice cool dance vibe in this one ~1
the drums on here is very nice wanted more out the intro but none the less still hot ~1
the drums sound really full ~1
the drums were really cool~1
the dub is dope & the vocals remind me of major laser~1
the effects that you used really mesh well together surprisingly and this record really knocks~1
the end of the end when the music must stop was done brilliantly~1
the energy is up tempo also.~1
the epicness of glados.~1
the eq seems a bit aimed more towards a house tune but you pull it off well in this remix!~1
the equestria nations unite together~1
the european parliament observed a minute's silence at noon~1
the fact is the emptyness comes from the lack of melody~1
the fat boys are back!!!~1
the feeling is great and the direction of all your music is perfect!~1
"the first initial ""drop"" sounds pretty sick but the groany growl after sounds kinda muddy, not bad though hope this helps"~1
the first thing i was reminded of when i heard this track is the consoles of old commodore, atari etc~1
the first two songs have amazing wobbles.~1
the flow is nice and overall sound is damn good~1
the flow on this is super cool~1
the force is strong with you!!!~1
the forward sound you want to achieve is not just done with compression~1
the fuckin money!~1
the fucking drop~1
the game has changed.~1
the giraffekiller ;)~1
the glitchyness stutteryness and stop n go action on this track is insane~1
the global idea is nice, but the refrain have to be more powerful! try with adding volume and compression to the kick and with more sidechain~1
the greatest progress between two tracks on soundcloud! congrats!~1
the groove works indeed.~1
the guitar samples are making this track sing~1
the harmonic start is pretty cool .....~1
the hats and cymbals work great with the kicks, nothing overdone here~1
the hats could be mixed in a bit cleaner, but very nice production.~1
the head~1
the head of my winker~1
the heavy compression you applied fits the style so well.~1
the heavy shiiiiiiit!~1
the heavyiest tune i made for sure haha~1
the hi hats and shakers as well as that misc percussion sound do wonders for the song~1
the hi hats are nice n clear the melody is perfect~1
the hi's sound a bit drowned out though~1
the high frequencies are slightly overpowering~1
the higher frequencies should be pushed more a little~1
the highs are very strong here, but it sounds good~1
the horns are beautiful!! the percs are amazing too and i'm loving that energy! we need an extended version!~1
the ice truckers - http://soundcloud.com/milanrecords/the-ice-truckers-tonights-the~1
the idea isnt too interesting but the mastering is dope and the sounds are dope so i could see a dope rapper on it~1
the illest wubs!~1
the immediate impression is like older deadmau5, not so much after the filter opens up but it's still cool~1
the incredible synths just blow my mind <3~1
the initial melody is played over far too many times with little to no variation, it gets redundant~1
the instrumental and vocals fit together alright but the drop could be stronger and the mix could be clearer.~1
the instrumentals are cool~1
the instruments are perfect.~1
the into takes you in to deep cosmic vibe really nice and intresting job~1
the intro is a bit weird...~1
the intro is pretty dope! can you come check out my remix for awakening and maybe drop a favorite? i have a personal goal of making it to 100 favorites~1
the intro is slow~1
the intro loop seens a bit discontinuous to me~1
the intro sounds a little bit like the intro of innocence-nero , the whole track is amazing :)~1
the intro sounds kinda like a japanese instrument! really cool! :dd~1
the intro starts off simple with an arp synth, and then you go into the drums, which are really tight and punchy, so props to that~1
the intro was amazing but this is just epic! very good song, nicely done!~1
the intro was diferent but all the track is good  ! nice work !~1
the intro was kind of too long and boring haha.:) thanks anyways! :)~1
the introductions drums are good at preparing listeners for the drop and once the drop starts the melody takes you through very good production keep at it~1
the irony kill the noise puts his name into.~1
the kick and snare are hitting me in all the right places~1
the kick drum is buried under the bass~1
the kick is a beast!~1
the kick is a bit too clear at the very beginning, but it fits in later..~1
the kick is another highlight as is the use of the stereo image..~1
the kick is so punchy!~1
the kick you added to it sounds cool~1
the king!!!!~1
the layering here gives this tune a great party feel~1
the layering is a bit loose personally but its just because deep swing has a tiny amount of swing on the original drums.~1
the lead is pretty wicked as well~1
the lead sounds a little loud, seems to overpower everything else~1
the lead sounds great nice almost piano sound~1
the lead stabs are cool~1
the leads are good sounds but well over powering, neeed to drop the vol a touch and mixdown ~1
the legend lives on..~1
the levels are perfectly synced and the transitions are solid~1
the levels are pretty good too~1
the lyrisist on kolombo - my own business is the cat in the picture~1
the magical touch to this production <3! nicely done man~1
the main lead synth you used is a very powerful sounding synth as well~1
the man body of the track, or the underlying bass work is nice, it has a good structure..but your accompanying elements and melodies always seem to be just thrown together in some experimental chaos as if you are trying to evoke emotions or garner an otogenous reaction....i like it, always have.~1
the master is doing it again <3~1
the master is simply perfect~1
the mastered version of this brings brand-new dimensions and clarity to this composed song!~1
the mastering sounds perfect!~1
the melodies are cool and i like the sound~1
the melodies go well together~1
the melodies you have going on play with each other nicely, and i never found myself thinking that they were messy~1
the melody and the ambience.~1
the melody could be a bit different sound wise but still nice~1
the melody is awesome and drums are crisp.~1
the melody is cool, very club, and i like the slower tempo and sharp snares, good vibe~1
the melody is great but i thinj it wil better if the vocals get more volume~1
the melody is nice - classic trance, melodic style~1
the melody is nice and original ~1
the melody's quite nice but it's repetitive overall! change it a bit and it'll be nice!~1
the melodys dont seem to match up~1
the midi is pretty sweet~1
the mids are not over powered by the bass..~1
the mind of a creative warrior comes shining through immediately~1
the mix comes through nice n hot~1
the mix really flows well from start to finish~1
the mix seems slightly mid scooped~1
the mixing is really tight~1
the mixing sounds solid as too.~1
the mixing sounds very professional~1
the mixing tight and the arrangement is strong throughout.~1
the monster~1
the mood of this really elevated me nice work man !!!!!!!!!~1
the more of your productions i hear, the more i like~1
the most bangin trap song i've heard in a while~1
the most best!!~1
the muh goes hard haah~1
the music calls up an experience and it calls up an emotion, so to me this a successful piece of work~1
the noisy leads in here are a really good addition~1
"the nutso break in the middle of my track ""bubbles"" is a randomized pattern, no nudging necessary"~1
"the only problem is, if someone is using a controller with ""sync"", it'll throw that off, so beatmatching is essential.."~1
the only recommendation i'd make is perhaps pull the hats down a bit (like 2db)~1
the only thing i have a bit qualms with is that stupid sound that plays occasionally that just makes me want to kick someone, everything else is golden~1
the only thing i think it needs is one more layer because it sounds a little basic but besides that im feelin it!~1
the only thing it might beenfit from is a little better eq'ing and perhaps some parallel compression or other treatment to further push the dynamics of this track~1
the original is one of my fave tracks from yesteryear so i'm feeling this deeper more tribal affair~1
"the original lacked that bit of a thump, but this is exactly what i was looking for :d

btw i found this track on dj ravine's we love electro 2 mix on youtube :)"~1
the original of this song is silly man, just wrong for edm~1
the original vibe with the electropop one is to good !! ~1
the other two reached belgium safely~1
the outhere brothers - shake it (2008) nice mashup~1
the pad on here is ice the break is cachy to real danceable~1
the pads and lead synths are gold.~1
the paino is very smooth good powerful snare u should change the kick to 808s it would hit way harder but this is still great..~1
the part wit my butt is brown tho~1
the percs of this track are nice, i like the overall flow good work~1
the percussion is just right on !~1
the percussions set the mood~1
the perfect combo.~1
the phuture!~1
the piano part is nice~1
the piano sound so clear and soft~1
the piano sounds a bit cheesy and it sounds like one of the synths is too fuzzy~1
the piano sounds well on this one, maybe a bit too loud~1
the pianos in this beat are addicting, the drum pattern is awesome!~1
the pitch diwn snare and dat formant~1
the pitch shift in her voice just makes it sound so much better :d~1
the plucks in the background is really good and the bass that fade in like that is epic man~1
the pressure of silence :) gives all of it a nice feeling...and the straight look forward...bang!~1
the progression makes this sound unique but relevant~1
the progression on this track is really drawn out~1
the progrssion is nice and i really enjoyed it~1
the pulsing sound of the lead synthesizer is nice~1
the quaky sound:o how u make it?~1
the rap is well down~1
the reckoning has come, surely the herd will overcome all and stand triumphant!~1
the reese on this one is massive man! big tune, and yeah all what deafblind said haha :)~1
the refill for this is epic too, thanks~1
the remix its good! its verty nicee!!check out my remix and fav it and ill return the favor:) thx!! saludos !~1
the rhodes sounding tremolo piano is nice touch!~1
the rhythm really hits the spot~1
the rhythm throughout the whole song is amazing! the vocal samples and the horn samples are great and that bassline is groovy!!~1
the rhythmn variations are hot too~1
the ridedrum is nice created makes a really mellow sound~1
the rising pitch afterwards keeps the tensions rising~1
the rs event was my first exposure~1
the running melody you got here is pretty dope.~1
the rythm you got on this track is nice~1
the sample work is really nice ! keep the good work ! ~1
the second change just broke me man! but good song,~1
the sections lead into each other nicely man!~1
the shakers are preety nice on this this is a very well arranged track everything suits each other well ~1
the shittttt!~1
the side chain is nice on the bass and synth~1
the sliced vocals sound really professional.~1
the slow attack is sick how it leads to the drop~1
the snare just pops! very nice work~1
the snare sounds the sickesy i like it how the song is put together to!~1
the snare's amazing and the chourus is very catchy and definitely reminds me of skrillex.~1
"the song gets terrible here because ""prob cause"" is fucking terrible."~1
the song is not really bad~1
the sound are great, and especially like the synth riff~1
the sound design in this track is unreal! props on bring fresh takes on played out genres!~1
the sound is clean and the mix is on point overall~1
the sound is clear and there's a good job on mix.~1
the sound of silent war :3~1
the sound of this just takes me back to summer listening to radio in the car when i was growing up.~1
the sound on this is awesome, good job on the remix!~1
the sound selection is excellent: a mix of bright/mellow, dirty/clean, hard/soft, deep/tight~1
the sounds are cool tho~1
the sounds are dope, i would like to hear the vocals a little higher.~1
the sounds are from native instruments reaktor free with free limited plugins~1
the sounds in this drop are 8-bit and chip tune like~1
the sounds you use are mixed together very well!~1
the stabs really make the house feel and vibe appear~1
the staccato feel of this track is ultra trippy~1
the start is too quiet for club or radio - get into mastering! you can find tips and tutorials on youtube.~1
the start was cool but then it kinda went down hill sorry~1
the starting singing is totally not happening~1
the stereo mix on this part is pretty crazy.~1
the sub bass goes in mono ;) just a tip~1
the subs are nice at the drop, well done~1
the subs hit hard~1
the synth is the best..~1
the synth itself is pretty dang good though~1
the synth lead could have been brought in a bit more progressively but that aside, wow! deffo got a favorite from us!~1
the synth sound set are very good~1
the synth stabbing on the drums here sounds cool~1
the synth textures, layering and arrangement are all good~1
the synth you used sounds great.~1
the synths go so well with everything else~1
the synths on this part are pretty cool.~1
the synths sound analog which i absolutely adore so nice work on this one friend.~1
the syth is so cool too!~1
the talking synth you engineered is pretty good.~1
the tempo drop sounds really cool!~1
the title is perfect for the time we live in...~1
the track is simple in composition, but it has a good groove to it! good stuff~1
the track selection is amazing!~1
the track sounds really cool~1
the transitions are sick~1
the trickle elements are jacked! nice thumper~1
the trumpet and guitar get this one sounding funky and lively~1
the two bestest tunes mixed xx~1
the use of samples are nice also~1
the use of this speech is cool~1
the vibe!!~1
the vocal chops are real tight 2~1
the vocal chops are really nice~1
the vocal samples really make this i kick-ass track!  dig it!~1
the vocal shouts make it really fresh! :)~1
the vocal stabs are cool, too.~1
the vocals are awesome~1
the vocals are cool too~1
the vocals are good sounding as well a little bit like cee lo green if that doesnt offend you good job~1
the vocals are nicley put in to~1
the vocals are really clear i would just suggest add a little reverb or delay to it to give it some depth other than that is real good keep it up.~1
the vocals are roaring and classy, and the beat is deep and full~1
the vocals are so clear~1
the vocals are so tight~1
the vocals are solid the hats or good and the overall melody is perfect nice job.~1
the vocals aren't really clear , drop sounds really good , it has a nice flow~1
the vocals come in very clean.~1
the vocals don't seem to be sitting right in the mix, try adding a multiband compressor and a little delay~1
the vocals in the background, so nice!~1
the vocals make the song for me~1
the vocals sound awesome~1
the vocals sound very grainy but other than that, perfect mixdown and mastering.~1
the vocals wrap around you like a thong in winter-in all the right places-then the melody and instrumentation keep the rest of you warm and not under arrest somewhere.....~1
the vocals!~1
the voice soundsd like a voice i heard in diablo 3, am i wrong or ?~1
the volume is really low for me~1
the volume low on this or is it me?~1
the vox are weird but nice bass~1
the vox sounds great~1
the wave form in the middle of the song looks like hairy 8bit boobs~1
the way you brought this is what it feels like in, took my breath away~1
the way you have chopped up and manipulated that vocal is very cool indeed, maybe try and work on making your bass fatter though~1
the way you use the sounds in this track is interesting~1
the whole thing is sick but the lead and drop dont fit eachother~1

the wobbble is like a machine gun~1
the wobble deep bass is off the chain i like the drum sequence and that sound in the break had some kind of filter i like the ruff sound that has !~1
the wobble is sick!!!~1
the wobble sounds are great! super-sounddesign man!~1
the wobbles are to loud on this~1
the woman's voice that comes in at 46.07 makes me want to lose it completely!~1

"there , jordan shoes even $ 43--$ 33 , nike shoes only $ 40--$ 30, and rolex watch only $ 80--$ 60
join with us , you' ll find it is right to cooperate with us"~1
there are a few moments where things cut in oddly, specifically with the crashes~1
there are maybe too many things going on at once, but i like how it sounds regardless~1
there are some unusual sounds in the track that i haven't really heard before~1
there aren't lazerz! you know the beat is awesome but what is a trap without lazers? (;~1
there could be more but that takes time to master.~1
there could be more in this break.a pad..keep the melody going after.eitherway nice groovy track.~1
there definitely should be some sort of progressing melody line.~1
there is a strange mood to this one, and not as 'in your face' as other dubstep stuff i've heard lately~1
there is an urgency of information rushing out of this track~1
there is just soo much awesome in this mix man, i love it and all of these selections!!~1
there is more room to fill out and i think that would help this already well sounding track to sound even better :)~1
there is no joke in your music!~1
"there is no such thing as ""too much subbase""."~1
there is not enough melody anywhere in this track~1
there is plenty of potential here~1
there is so much awesome-ness going on in this song! featured @ http://www.themusicphoenix.com/2013/01/22/dj-kawal/~1
there it is~1
there it is!~1
there it is, the signature rex kick to the face! excellent as always my friend, always look forward to the next track!~1
there needs to be plenty of changes to this to improve it, but this right here is magic.~1
there seems to be a huge desert here....~1
there too get rid of this until the song goes back no voices there~1
there we go! good stuff~1
there we go!!!~1
there we go, i thought the mix sounded a little fuzzy but i guess u meant for that effect in the beginning~1
there will be another version soon - and some remixes (anyone who wants to join: drop me a line)~1
there you have the melodic thinking lines from z.prime~1
there!!! go and remember me...!~1
there's a cool sega vibe off this track :d whats the name? ~1
there's a noise you use a bit, i can't identify it, but it was nice touch!~1
there's alot of energy here~1
there's some nice contrasting moods and direction changes in this one~1
there's some nice sounds in there though.~1
there's some weird movement happening with the sounds in your stereo field~1
therefore improving it.~1
theres a lot of crunchy goodness goin on!~1
theres a party on the roof!!!~1
theres a white girl in town~1
theres some real bangers in the bag~1

these vocals give me eargasm~1
these voice sample things are cool.~1
these wobbles rang :o~1
they a split tracks for this, the link dont work mate~1
they are just awesome~1
they are stil able to rock the house~1
they are too upfront~1
they both killed this.~1
they forgot skrillex~1
they just hog the cpu and it lags and its really frustrating!  but thanks for the check up!~1
they lead the track nicely, well done!~1
they sound a little dated.~1
they sound like you're far away, and they're a little soft, but the piano is nice too.~1
they sound really professional and go well with the emotion of the instrumental aspect~1
they surprisingly work pretty well together lol..~1
they were amazing~1
they were comforted by the royal couple as they left from a military airport near brussels~1
they wouldn't make a bad decision giving you the slot! great selection of tunes, nice buildup in the set and good mixes between the songs~1
thi is a nice track man :0 be good if you could get some vocals too ;)~1
thick and warm~1
thin lead, but that minimalistic sound you create is rlly cool~1

this beat goes really hard!, but it would be much nicer if it was longer! good work on the piano snares and the rest sounds legit~1
this beat has a nice groove to it the horns sound really  good in the mix and it definitely makes you want to dance~1
this beat is cool i like the horns in the beat its sounds pretty cool and is original for house beats in the most part because you dont hear a lot of that~1

this break and intro is so melodic, love it~1
this break here is purely 'eargasmic'~1
this break is awesome :p as well as the entire track~1
this break is dope~1
this break is the best part because the repetitive synth stab finally stopped but now the vocals feel like they are being brought up from some compressor too much or something i would go back to the drawing board with this one the hatz are good tho so props for those~1
this break is tight!~1
this breakdown section is very n ice--i might lower the levels or throow in a filter just to help build the drama a little, but really great work!~1
this build is sick!~1
this build is so good man honestly~1
this build up is insane, feelin the shut up sample as well..~1
this build-up! yum~1
this could be a new dubstep, or going back to old classics like skream.~1
this could be really dirty!~1
this could have been really cool :x need to work on the mix/masteing maybe~1
this could use so much more mixing...~1
this datsik excision track kicks serious ss~1

this is a good track but i think the mixdown is a bit muddy, like if it was a bit to much compressed~1
this is a good track right here~1
this is a grat sounding tune..big ups~1
this is a great mashup very sick adding above & beyond to this track~1
this is a great mix! wish i had it a few days ago at my bbq~1
this is a great mix..~1
this is a great section with a happy feel~1
this is a great tune man, i think the clap may be a bit on the loud side but this very chill~1
this is a great tune, but i do feel the eqing could blend together more, great work though very nice vibe through out, maybe more reverb :)~1
this is a house banger for sure~1
this is a killer......~1
this is a legit remix~1
this is a major fatty guys!~1
this is a middle ground between chill wave trap and trap~1
this is a nice dnb song, but i feel the bass towards the end could have come in a little bit earlier, along with one more synth or two.~1
this is a nice idea dude! although the wobbles are really not mixed properly with the tracks, same goes with the whole e.p, great ideas, but the mix isn't right in my opinion~1
this is a nice preview.~1
this is a nice remix~1
this is a perfect example of horrible dubstep~1
this is a perfect set cloiser~1
this is a pretty classy remix, nice work~1
this is a pretty sick song not gunna lie~1
this is a proper techno track! absolutely love it! great elements have been used!~1
this is a quite good intro man,killing it up on the boom for the drop!~1
this is a real fucking legit mix brah &gt;.&lt;~1
this is a really clean production~1
this is a really cool and laid back track it feels more midtempo than progressive but thats ok its still nice~1
this is a really crazy drop~1
this is a really dope track! i love the vibes and some really great synth work!~1
"this is a really great setlist, man! :d
i love deep house, this set is real tech, almost tellin a story:d all songs seem at a constant volume! real great work, sure this works on floors well"~1
this is a really smooth track! good work on the master~1
this is a relentless aggressive intro and i love it!~1
this is a sick production~1
this is a sick track~1
this is a sick tune!~1
this is a smooth track with a classic sample~1
this is a sweet remix.someone finally did this.this is just too epic for your ears:)~1
this is a trancy build up i like that and i also liked the breakdown~1
this is a unique sounding saw bass, liking the track~1
this is a very complex melody, but it sounds absolutely awesome!~1
this is a very cool mix ~1
this is a very cool, much fresher production than the original which is an absolute classic in my mind..~1
this is a very danceable tune~1
this is a very nice track, keep up the good work~1
this is a very nice track....quite upbeat~1
this is a very professional sounding drum and bass track~1
this is a very repetitive track however i could see it being played at a club scene~1
this is a very sexy tune! i love the way the claps come in on this tune! very big record its ready to go~1
this is a well done remix right here everything is on point and sounds really good~1
this is a wiked production man! great track not really a big fan of the high lfo wobs but i like the rock blend mash up!~1
this is a wonderful drop~1
this is absolutely crazy!~1

"those on board the bus that <b><a href=""http://www.comelygirls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">work footwear</a><b> crashed were from the stekske primary school in lommel, near the dutch border, and from st lambertus in heverlee, near leuven, with the numbers roughly even"~1
those pads are wicked and the drop into the chopped up dubstep in epic~1
those plucks go hard~1
those plucks have nice saturation and a big rich sound~1

those subtle funky plucks have a nice movement on them and sit really well in the mix~1
those synth sounds!~1
those this sparkly nuttiness~1
those tones! sound of happiness!~1
those vocals are pretty dark~1
though i personally the slwer part much more.~1
though i really can't tell if you are being a troll or if you're just a kid lacking manners...yes, i'm that annoyed at this point..~1

transformers song right here~1
transformers!!!~1
transitions are fantastic n good vibes it delivers!~1
transitions are too smooth~1
trap ? wicked deepness building quite dark~1
trap indeed, needs a bit of sleaze like in longer vocal dropoffs, and a bit of fster trance.~1
trap is echt kut muziek xd    ik heb me eigen laptop pas over maandje terug wss en kan dan pas weer producen..~1
trap is so sick~1
trap is solid man, nice production :p~1
trap meets hard style.~1
trap shit!!! <3~1
trap style~1
trap+electro=best idea ever~1
treat one with a different fx chain to get some more movement into it~1

tropical!~1
troppo confusionale~1
trudno~1
true that!!!~1
true!~1
true, but i did notice one of the guys in from first to last follows hallywood on twitter, and since that's skrillex's old band it leads me to believe skrillex has heard of him ~1
truly a sick remix, intro is nice and the build is amazing well done with the mastering as well~1
truly amazing :d~1
truly gangster~1
trumpet <3333~1
trumpet rocks men amazing~1
trust the distinct!!~1
trusting that inner voice!  :)~1
try adding a short melody .~1
try again~1
try agen~1
try altering the levels a little~1
try different kicks and transitions! other wise its great!~1
try making a chorus of the vocals or maybe duplicate it and try adding a little more reverb to it.~1
try playin around to get different soudns that will co relate with this one ! other than that i like the feel of the track :d good work :d~1
try shortening up the intro a bit and just make it more percussive less synth~1
try sidechaining the bass at different frequencies to allow the percussion through (below 250 hz sidechained to the bass, above 9000 hz sidechained to the hats and in between sidechained to the snare)~1
try throwing more variation on your beat.~1
try to add something that is different to the whole song~1
try to clean up your ongoing open hihats mate~1
try to let the bass drop one bar l8ter then you would have thought, when the bass drops of course, thats an awesome trap effect, i use it all the time~1
try to listen more to artist you like and try first to copy what u hear...~1
"try usin more of the vocals from the other one as well and it seems like you got some spots that its a littlee off , good creativity
"~1
try working on making them on time and i think it will sound great!~1

unnecessarily long, sounds like filler to me~1
unnhhhh.~1
"unnnh ~ reminiscent of bassnectar there on the drop"~1
unphased by these cat like noises, in my eyes/ears (haha) they are unneccessary, work on the mix, too and after a proper mastering this will rock!~1

volume is kind of low, maybe turn this up, or fade it in more, you got good sounds here~1
voluminous.~1
voornamelijk ranzig in vergelijking met het origineel de bass is daar zwaar maar zuiver jij heb duidelijk het filth gehalte wat naar boven bij gesteld :) en je hebt duidelijk meer nadruk op de hoge tonen gelegd in het stuk van 1:25 tot 1:50  kortom een zeer geslaagde remix !!!~1
vox sample is sick , well doen~1

waooow ~1
warm and glitchy...gets dark at :30 tho...stays fuzzy i like it~1
warm noodles indeed~1
was definitely kind of hoping that it would just drop into a nice clean subby thing and not distorted :/ not bad but think it could have been better if it was more chill~1
was ein dicker drop!~1
was eine bombe...~1
was expecting a dirty bass line but you went the other way good song!!~1
was not so into the vocals (mostly coz nobody does it better as sinead o'connor)~1
was pretty chuffed with how it came together.~1
was pretty good just make sure you keep the beat alive withought all the dull moments~1
was remember deadmau5~1
was that the  half life 2 civil protection sound?~1
was thinking a hardstyle drop would work well there, but was still caught off-guard by those club kicks~1
was too lazy focusing on the  bassline :) ~1
was wondering where you got to! great track mate:) hope all is well..~1
wasnt digging that intro but this redeemed it nice work~1
wasnt wat i expected at all nice work mayn!~1

what are you doing to get such nice acoustic effect with all your sounds, specially basses sound so deep but delicate!~1
what do u think now man? does it need anything?~1
what do you like~1
what do you mean? im confused~1
what do you suggest to improve the style~1
what do you use for the high synth ?~1
what download ?~1
what genre did you submit it to on remixcomps?~1
what gives i cant download~1
what great composition! definitely better than the original.~1
what happen to the drop??~1
what happened to you....~1
what is even going on~1
what is it? sounds a bit konichi style...~1
what is the name of this song right here???~1
what is this amazing sound? it's beautiful! ~1
what mathizmmmm~1
what plugin is this? and where's the dl?~1
what saws? i am guessing either retrologue or some external vst...~1
what should i say? perfect, i like all in your track! good luck in the challenge ;)~1
what song is on the  1m -17 seconds ??~1
what song is this?~1
what sort of sound would you suggest? thanks for the feedback too! :d~1

when i heard you were australian i was glad :3~1
when is the deadline?~1
when is the release?~1
when is this outttt~1
when the beat drops you die~1
when the drop hits, it's nice and bright~1
when the heat gets hi~1
when the track dropped the synth was overpowering and pushed back the other sounds,  its just to loud imo, drop it down and eq tweak it so it matches and compress to give clarity and bring the other samples back out~1
when this dropped at paradiso i almost shit myself~1
when this is remix of an older song!~1
when this whole part drops its over~1
"when u get time, check out some of my music

work~1
work a bit on the drums and on the whole buildup and this will actually have a chance~1
work it~1
work more my man ;]~1
work more on your sound design and everything needs to put in a correct place of scope :)~1
work on the drums a bit more~1
work on the mixdown~1
work safety zone, dont forget ur hardhat~1
working on one right now.~1
works out tempo wise because the synths have a guitarish vibe and sound about them~1
works well nice sounds and the drums are tight~1
worst bass i've ever heard~1
worth the 94.9 mb download.~1
wot~1
would also be a suitable title~1
would be a great one to drop deep in my house set~1
would be great at a rave~1
would be nice to see some more work on the synth.~1
would have liked to hear a bit of changing in the sounds using macros and evelopes.~1
would have preferred it 320mp3, as for we have to convert it ourselves to play it on most stereos or in the car.~1
would like to mix like you~1
would like to see you bring in maybe a melody in the higher register at this point...i think it would fit in well with the lower one that has been going for a while~1
would love a copy mate but none of those links work ;)~1
would love to drop this tune tonight in honolulu, but the dl is filled ~1
would love to earn that mastering bundle :)~1
would love to know how i could make it sound more rich....?  any criticism is welcome.~1
would love to rock this tune someday~1
would love to see it happen for you~1
would love to see more from you!~1
would make a great background tune for a fighting game or fighting scene in a movie~1
would maybe have some more of this sound introduced earlier in the track for continuity~1
would mix well with the teddy killerz remix of boss wave :)~1
would never touch any of my sets lol, but was fun to make nonetheless~1
would prefer if it dropped sooner~1
"would you mind follow me and staying in touch? 
i'm a producer and recording artist, let me know if you need beats! thanks."~1
wouldn't be the same without them~1
"wou~wou~wou~"~1
