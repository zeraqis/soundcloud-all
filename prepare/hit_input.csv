125305727,https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/125305727,"I really like this song. Unlike most chill-out dubstep songs, you actually give a focus to the soundscapes. The intro starts off simple with an arp synth, and then you go into the drums, which are really tight and punchy, so props to that. The melodies you have going on play with each other nicely, and I never found myself thinking that they were messy. Also worth saying is the way you implement an Amen break, if I'm not mistaken, into a dubstep song. I really like that, it drives the song along quite nicely. Your main drop section is nicely laid out, with enough variation to make things sound sweet, but not so much that it loses focus. The arp is a great sound, and I really like the way you've used it, especially with the notes you choose. They are just awesome. Great job on that regard. The breakdown is nicely made, and you transition beautifully into the drums, only to take them out again, great way of adding impact to the drop, which is really more towards chill instead of heavy dubstep. Great work... I've said it many times, but great work.",drop,7466,7.466,00:07
